    <p>The best and worst summer of my life started shortly before I graduated from high school.</p>

    <p>It was close to six o’clock in the evening when my dad finally decided to call it a day and got up from the computer desk. It wasn’t that I really cared or followed his work so closely; I could care less to be honest, but since his was the only computer in the house and, more importantly, the only phone line entirely dedicated to connecting to the Internet, I had no choice other than to wait until I could have the computer to myself. But once I did, from that point onward, that small breakfast-turned-to-home-office nook would be all mine until seven in the morning the next day if I so desired.</p>

    <p>The strong smell of stale cigarettes, all ten of them he dutifully smoked at the end of the day when he got home from work, was the first thing I had to get used to before sitting down on the still-warm fake leather chair, but I was in a hurry. I’d waited the entire day for the mail carrier to deliver two critical packages, and now that I’d had them for the last three hours, I just couldn’t wait any longer.</p>

    <p>First, I opened the CD-ROM tray of our Compaq Presario 4110 Desktop, ripped the shrink wrap off the American OnLine (AOL) 2.5 CD, and popped it into the computer, gently but firmly forcing the tray to close a little bit faster. “C’mon, you piece of shit,” I murmured. The article I’d seen in a magazine had promised that this much-anticipated upgrade would make the entire user experience much faster, but more importantly, give its users the ability to use other applications than the ones provided by the AOL ecosystem, such as the Netscape web browser and, more importantly, the other application that had been delivered earlier: a CD installer for the I.C.Q. messenger.</p>

    <p>For the last year or so, I’d come to rely on the chat channels and AIM client provided by AOL to keep up with my school buddies and make new online friends who shared my interests in programming and web page design. But the more I met new people and expanded those friendships, the more I heard about the broader and less restricted corners of the Internet, where information was limitless and knowledge was king. And knowledge-seeking was exactly what I was after.</p>

    <p>Ever since I’d met Barret twelve months earlier, I couldn’t think of anything other than learning everything I could about the programming language called Microsoft Visual Basic 5.</p>

    <p>Barret was the godson of Gianna, an older Italian woman who sublet the basement of a place where we lived for a couple of years before my parents bought our own house in Cliffside Park, New Jersey.</p>

    <p>He showed up at Gianna’s one day during the summer of 1996 to spend a week with her, and the very first thing she did was send him upstairs to the first floor where we lived so he wouldn’t be bored. I think she didn’t know how to entertain a 13-year- old kid. Her own kids had grown up and moved out a long time ago, and she welcomed the opportunity to spend some quality time with her godson from Massachusetts, as long as that time didn’t exceed more than a couple of hours a day.</p>

    <p>Barret and I didn’t click right away, probably because of our age difference and what back then I considered to be his lack of “real-life experience.” At that time my priority was strictly focused on how to get a girlfriend, my first one at that, while he only talked about computers and this new thing called the Internet. Yes, sure, I found those topics interesting, but being at the tail end of my teenage years and already flirting with the process of college applications, I didn’t want to be the only one in my group of friends who was yet to have a romantic relationship with a girl.</p>

    <p>At the end of that week, something must have rubbed off from Barret on me because I started showing more interest in learning about programming, going as far as getting my own pirated copy of Visual Basic from a warez site I found online and installing it on my dad’s computer. Over the next year, Barret and I exchanged hundreds of emails sharing coding recipes, games, and applications I could use to continue learning my way around the world wide web, and learn I did.</p>

    <p>Every day I used my 7th period in high school to get all my homework done so I wouldn’t have to do anything at home other than play on my Nintendo 64 until my dad clocked out. It was then that my real education started.</p>

    <p>The Internet opened up a brand-new world for anyone who wanted to experience new things but didn’t like the idea of going to school to learn about them. Sure, Mr. Santos and Mrs. Hofferman made Computer Math and High School Physics interesting subjects, but the feeling of complete freedom and control that learning online provided was something that very quickly got a powerful hold on me.</p>

    <p>Instead of having to sit in class every day from 7:50 in the morning until 2:45 in the afternoon, every day a slow repetition of the previous days, learning the same subjects in 45-minute intervals, I wanted to control the direction and speed at which I learned topics that were not even offered at school. Where else could I learn the skills to build a complete web page fully customized with my own CGI scripts to dynamically generate content based on interactions from those visiting my web site on Geocities? Where else could I meet people from virtually anywhere in the world from the comfort of my home?</p>

    <p>It used to be that if I wanted to learn about a new topic or just brush up on something I hadn’t used for some time, I’d have to beg my parents to drive me to the public library or to the gigantic Barnes and Noble bookstore down in Edgewater, where I’d stay the entire day writing down ideas and copying code samples from the books I couldn’t afford to buy, so I could try them out when I got back home. The Internet gave me access to a massive, always open, always available, online library, and as long as I knew how to plug the right search terms into the AltaVista search engine, I felt that I could go on learning forever.</p>

    <p>As time went on I learned how computers worked, how to fix them, how to get rid of software viruses, install printers and scanners, and as word got around that I knew how to do these things, people started paying me to come to their houses and fix their problems.</p>

    <p>It was easy money for sure, and it was coming in as fast as I could find new customers who couldn’t be bothered to learn how to operate a computer. Having money also meant that I could finally start buying hard-to-find online programming books, which eventually led me to start a brand-new enterprise: writing small desktop applications for people who felt the need to steal information from their friends and relatives.</p>

    <p>Yes, it was very irresponsible of me to enable people to use technology to trick others, but what did I know? I was only 17 and didn’t really think of the consequences that my actions could have on others, and as long as the money was coming in and my programming skills were being noticed online, I didn’t give a shit about what people were doing with my creations.</p>

    <p>For example, my friend Ferdinand was locked out of AOL when his sister decided to change his password on him after an argument they had. She had the master account, and as the sole owner of it, she dished out new accounts and online access any way she wanted. Crossing her could get you a few days of no Internet at all until she was adequately flattered and cajoled into relenting and restoring things to normal, but this time Ferdinand felt that she’d crossed a line he was no longer willing to toe.</p>

    <p>Writing a fake login application that for all purposes looked and acted exactly like the AOL application was pretty trivial for me by then, and capturing the master ac- count’s password the next time Ferdinand’s sister went online and saving it in a hidden file that only I could access took less than an hour after I installed it on their computer. From that point onward, it was only a matter of getting my $50 before I uninstalled the application and revealed to him the master password. Whatever he chose to do with that information, it was none of my business.</p>

    <p>The upgrade went faster than I expected, or perhaps it was just my excitement, but once the AOL CD was ejected and the computer rebooted, I put the second CD into the tray, and several agonizing minutes later I had I.C.Q. installed and ready for a test run. Lately, there had been a series of news articles talking about people getting tricked into sharing their credit cards and even their social security numbers by people pretending to work at AOL, and security had been increased to monitor anyone posing as AOL administrators.</p>

    <p>Luckily for me, my preferred screen name, VBGuy, was still up for grabs in the I.C.Q. servers, and as soon as I was online I immediately searched and found the person I was looking for: SnowWhite.</p>

    <p>Apparently SnowWhite had heard of my programming skills with the AOL interface from someone online, and earlier that week she (I assumed it was a female, but there was no way to tell for sure) had sent a message to my Juno email address telling me that she had a lucrative proposition for me.</p>

    <div class="chat">
    <p>VBGuy: d0 y0u und32574nd 1337 5p34k?</p>
    <p>SnowWhite: Hi! You don’t know me but I heard that you have experience programming for the AOL chat channels. I want to hire your services for a job.</p>
    <p>SnowWhite: What?</p>
    <p>VBGuy: d0 y0u und32574nd 1337 5p34k?</p>
    <p>SnowWhite: I’m sorry, but I don’t understand you. I thought that you spoke English...</p>
    </div>

    <p>I sighed deeply. Every now and then I was approached by script kiddies, online people who had no respect for or any interest in learning the art of writing beautiful code. They only knew how to download programs already written by someone else and use them to raise hell around the web, even if they had no clue what the programs were really doing under the hood.</p>

    <div class="chat">
    <p>VBGuy: Sigh. Of course I speak English! Do you understand leet speak? I prefer to do business work this way</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Young man, I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about. What is “leet speak” and why is it important that I speak it?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Young man? What are you, someone’s grandmother? :P</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: As a matter of fact, yes, actually. Make that a grandmother of three lovely young kids.</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Okay, okay, I don’t need to know the whole story. What do you want? How did you know to contact me using my Juno email address?</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: That’s what the instructions on your web site in Geocities said I should do. Did I do something wrong? I’m still learning my way around AOL.</p>

    <p>VBGuy: No, no, you did the right thing. I guess it isn’t every day that I deal with a grandmother, that’s all...</p>

    <p>VBGuy: So, what can I do for you? Are you trying to get hold of someone’s password? Looking for illegal content? With a nickname like SnowWhite, maybe you have a fetish for small men?</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Heavens no! I don’t want anything illegal, and what do you take me for?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Okay, so what can I do for you?</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Look, I am a law-abiding citizen and will have nothing to do with anything illegal or illicit, do you hear me?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Listen, lady, if you are really a woman, one can never be too careful. I’m a serious professional, so what do you need from me?</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Young man! I don’t want to waste your or my time, so let me go right to it.</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Okay, let’s have it</p>
    <p>SnowWhite: I need you to help me with a Monopoly game.</p>
    <p>VBGuy: ... excuse me?</p>
    <p>SnowWhite: Monopoly. You know the board game? Have you ever played Monopoly?</p>
    </div>

    <p>For the next 90 minutes SnowWhite and I went over the project she had for me. The more we chatted, the more I started to believe that I was really talking to someone’s grandmother, just one who was a little bit more tech savvy than other grandmothers, including my own. As far as I could tell, my grandmother, the only grandparent I still had alive, had never even seen a computer. By the time we were done talking, I felt like I’d known SnowWhite all my life.</p>

    <p>SnowWhite told me that growing up, she had always been an extrovert, always go- ing places and making friends, something that seemed to come quite easily to her. As she got older, she never allowed anything to affect her desire to keep up with her friends and family. She had been married for 35 years and gave birth to three children, “all grown up and with families of their own.” In 1992, after a long and valiant battle against lung cancer, Asterio, her husband, passed away. Then in 1996 she had a hip surgery that made getting around a much harder process, forcing her to look for different ways to keep in touch and continue to stay active. “A rolling stone gathers no moss,” she wrote a couple of times during our chat, and now that she found herself stuck at home nursing her “Hip 2.0,”—her words, not mine—she had spent part of her retirement money on a computer and decided to dive head first into this new world of technology.</p>

    <p>Once SnowWhite felt comfortable dealing with Microsoft Windows 95 and getting online on AOL, her granddaughter taught her how to explore the chat rooms that come pre-configured in the Community menu. From then on, she was able to fairly quickly start building new friendships and even host a trivia game night every Wednesday evening, typing the questions from an old deck of Trivial Pursuit cards into her own chat channel and tracking the number of right answers from those who joined her every week.</p>

    <p>“I don’t mind keeping all this information on paper and typing it up in the channel,” she said, “but my memory is not as sharp as it used to be,” and there were only so many times she could reuse her limited trivia questions before people had memorized them. A couple of weeks back she had started hosting bingo games, but now she wanted to try something different and fun, and hosting a game of Monopoly with her AOL friends would, in her opinion, be just perfect.</p>

    <div class="chat">
    <p>SnowWhite: Can you do it?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: Hmmm I’m going to have to do some research into AOL’s Game Chat’s protocols. I’ve never done anything this complicated before, to be honest</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Does that mean that you may not be able to do it?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: ... it could mean that, sure. But I need a bit of time to look into it. I have a friend whose dad works for AOL, so he may be able to get me some documentation about any existing APIs they may have</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: AP-what?</p>

    <p>VBGuy: APIs. It stands for Application Programming Interface. It’s like a contract that helps programmers understand what types of interactions AOL’s Game Chat respond to, how to make them, the type of data it requires, how it should be formatted, etc</p>

    <p>SnowWhite: Okay. I’ll just pretend that I understood everything that you just said :)</p>
    <p>VBGuy: hahaha funny</p>
    </div>

    <p>We wrapped up our chat and agreed to meet again in a few days so I could share what I’d learned and work out the details, including how much I was going to charge for the job. My mind was abuzz with the challenges that this project seemed to offer. Writing desktop applications or web pages was something that I’d done multiple times, but I’d never written anything that had to interact with another application that supposedly was completely protected from outside applications.</p>

    <p>I loaded my Juno CD and fired off an email to my friend Todd whose dad worked for AOL.</p>

    <div class="chat">
    <p>Yo, remember that favor you owed me? It’s time to pay the piper. I need anything you can get me about the APIs used by AOL for their Game Chat protocols. Your dad must have an old manual lying around somewhere. After this, we’re even.</p>
    </div>

    <p>AOL had been under pressure to secure their users’ information since their last data breach fiasco, when a disgruntled developer walked out of their Washington, D.C., office with a hard drive full of account names, passwords, and credit card numbers and posted it all online the very next day. Getting information about their APIs was going to be hard, and their security was going to be tighter than a gnat’s ass.</p>

    <p>I spent the next two hours reading up on the rules and game dynamics for Monopoly, downloading the manual straight from Hasbro’s website. I also played a couple of rounds of games on AOL just to get a feeling for what was possible. I knew that I’d be way out of my element if I were to take on this job, but I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t also excited about the challenge of writing a multiplayer online game. It would push me and my coding skills to a much higher level.</p>

    <p>I was just about getting ready to sign out and get some shut-eye when my Juno email notification bar, one of my own inventions, chimed. I automatically clicked the flashing icon to display a list of all new email messages and their subject so I could decide whether I wanted to open the Juno email server or not. What I saw took my breath away.</p>
