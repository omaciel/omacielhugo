title: GNOME Foundation update

I'd like to extend my (unofficial) congratulations to the new **GNOME
Foundation Board of Directors**! ([unofficial
results](http://foundation.gnome.org/vote/results.php?election_id=5))
Nice to see **Luis**\' charisma showing in the results! :) The new board
can definitely count with my support!

I also want to thank all of those who voted for me! I feel very
privileged that you guys believed in me and I can only hope to be able
to continue pushing for my ideas and ideals. :)
