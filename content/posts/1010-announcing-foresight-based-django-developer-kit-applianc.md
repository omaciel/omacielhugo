If you remember one of my last [posts](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1187),
I wanted to eventually migrate my [Django Developer Kit
Appliance](http://bit.ly/byzBLV) to use [Foresight
Linux](http://foresightlinux.org) as the underlying operating system...
and I am proud to announce that I have made huge strides toward this
goal!

Thanks to the guidance of some fellow [rPathians](http://www.rpath.com),
I managed to get an almost ready for production **Django 1.2.3 +
PostgreSQL 8.4 + Python 2.6.2** and **lots** of **Django modules** and
**latest versions** for **Git, Mercurial, Bzr**, and **Subversion**
ready to be used!

What didn't make into this version? The web based management system is
not present and is very possible I may have missed a small package along
the way. But I will keep updating the appliance with newer versions of
Django modules and will try to create a helpful environment Â for Django
developers out there! And you can always keep your appliance up to date
running **conary updateall** from the command line.

Oh, I have created a default djangouser and djangoproject user and
database (PostgreSQL) for you too!

Feel like taking the appliance for a spin? The following images are
