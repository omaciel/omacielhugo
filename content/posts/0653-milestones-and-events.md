title: Milestones and Events
---

Quick post to mention a couple of personal milestones and events:

-   Today is my 1-year anniversary at [rPath](http://www.rpath.org). It
    also marks 1 year since I stopped doing work with **VB.NET/C\#** and
    **PL/SQL** and embarked in a brand new world of **Python**, and
    web-by programming... There is not a day that I don't learn
    something new!
-   Sept. 29th marked 1 year since I left **New Jersey** for **North
    Carolina**! Besides the advantages of working with such a smart
    bunch (see above), I now get to spend quality time with my wife and
    two daughters. I get to see them grow and learn, and **that** is
    priceless!
-   October 16th will be my **7th wedding anniversary**! Marrying
    Elizabeth was about the smartest thing I have ever done!
-   I will be attending this year's [FOSSCamp
    2007](http://www.fosscamp.org/HowToAttend), together with my friend
    **Ken Vandine**. Looking forward to seeing **Jorge** and **Jono**
    again!
