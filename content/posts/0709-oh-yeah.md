While I was busy at work, [Openbox
3.4.5](http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page) was released! As
always, I've packaged it for Foresight Linux (the 2-devel branch) and
you can get it using **conary** or **PackageKit**.

I also took the time last night to pimp
[PyPanel](http://pypanel.sourceforge.net/) with a few patches and bump
[Nitrogen](http://projects.l3ib.org/nitrogen/) to 1.2 (not shown in the
screenshot).

Speaking of Nitrogen, I looked around for an easy and straight forward
way to change the desktop wallpaper in a non-GNOME environment and was
amazed at how GNOME-centric they all were. Some hacks involved issuing
gconf2 commands... :/ Anyone know of a pythonic, non-GNOME-centric way
of doing this? Maybe using python-xlib?
