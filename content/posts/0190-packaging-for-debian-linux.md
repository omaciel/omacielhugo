title: Packaging for Debian Linux
---

Complying with my decision to learn how to package software for
Debian-based distros, I spent some (unfortunately very little) time this
weekend going over
[this](http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/PackagingTutorial)
tutorial on packaging for Debian. Almost everything worked as per the
instructions, minus some minor changes I had to perform in order to end
up with a working .deb file. The experience was very rewarding and I
have already started to plan more "real world" practice trials to get
the hang of it!
