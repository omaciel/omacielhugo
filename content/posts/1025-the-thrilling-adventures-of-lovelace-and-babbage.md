Spent a good chunk of my free time reading all 9 (out of 10) parts of
[Lovelace and Babbage Vs The
Organist](http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/series/organist/) this
weekend! I don't know where to begin to describe how incredibly awesome
this comic is! The graphics, the clever writing and jokes, even the
sometimes absurd plot twists all combine for delivering a fantastic, fun
reading experience!

I highly recommend that you read at least a few episodes and allow
yourself to wander around the many links and tidbits about **Charles
Babbage**, **Ada Lovelace**, **Quasiamicable Pair**, musical
instruments, math and many other items in the **notes** section!
