Here is what's kept me up late these last 3 nights: Installing [Gentoo
Linux](http://www.gentoo.org) onto **Houdini** (AMD 64Â 3400+ 1GB RAM)
and getting Windows XP to run under [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com).
This may be a bit unorthodox but I wanted to have access to some
Windows-only applications (such as Visual Studio 2003) without having to
keep an extra computer at home with the sole purpose of running Windows.
I wonder if I can install and play [WoW](http://www.worldofwarcraft.net)
under this scenario without much of a performance loss???

I chose to go with [Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net) and some
other "light-weight" applications since I don't really need a lot of GUI
to do what I want. I'm not sure if all the new
[Mono](http://www.mono-project.com)/C\#-based applications have been
ported to x86-64 yet but I want to install
[F-Spot](http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/),
[Blam!](http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Blam) and be able to do some
GUI programming with C\# too.

[Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/), [Eterm](http://www.eterm.org/),
and [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com).
