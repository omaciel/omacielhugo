title: Top 10 Reasons for Wearing a Kilt
---

Because through out history, men have worn un-bifurcated garments.

Because if women had an appendage hanging between their legs we
guarantee you they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be wearing pants.

Freedom, and increased mobility.

You only go around once, so why shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you be as comfortable
as possible.

All men deserve air conditioning in the summer. You will chafe no more.

No more adjust, right side, left sideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Say goodbye to **wedgies**.

A word about the pockets: Unlike pants, the UtilikiltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pockets
are only sewn down on top, so that they move with the garment but not
with your leg. No more bulky crap contorting the shape of your leg. The
Workman's can carry an entire six pack. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to wear
your cell phone on your belt. With the Wrkms kilt, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need
a tool belt (for lighter stuff.)

The Utilikilt is made in the USA . You are supporting local industry.
Your mojo will thank you.

**Easy access ...**

Fringe benefits:

A. Physical: Your virility may increase. You will experience the
pleasing sensation of air conditioning. B. Mental: Wearing a kilt shows
a sense of security with yourself, and you will inspire much debate in
others. C. Spiritual: Without physical constrictions, you burden will be
lighter, your sense of freedom less impaired, and your sense of
yourself, will have room to grow.
