title: Where Do We Get These People?
---

While typing my last post I was interrupted by a so-called ".Net
Developer who just earned his PMP." He's been "featured" here before for
asking "very intelligent questions." =) This time he told me he had just
bundled some application and given to a DBA to run it when they received
an error message: **Oracle\[blah blah blah\].dll not found**!!!

> \"So this program you wrote is trying to connect to an Oracle
> database?\", I asked. "Yes". "And what technology are you using to
> connect?" "Huh???" "Are you using ODP.NET?" "HUH???" "Are you using
> Oracle Data Provider for .NET?" "Yes." "Does the client also have it
> OR have you included it with your application?" "HUH???"

And on and on it goes...
