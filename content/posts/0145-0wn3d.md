Today Firefox gave me a major scare when, instead of logging me to my
website so I could write a post, it took me to
<http://meta.wikipedia.org>!!! WTF??? I then fired up IE and tried it

some more detective work. I successfully logged to my web host's control
panel and checked the internet stats for the last few days... Boy, was I
shocked when I saw this:

Id really like to believe that many requests had been performed this
Wednesday but I highly doubt it. Have emailed my host and asked them to
investigate.
