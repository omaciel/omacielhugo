Today Firefox gave me a major scare when, instead of logging me to my
website so I could write a post, it took me to
<http://meta.wikipedia.org>!!! WTF??? I then fired up IE and tried it

some more detective work. I successfully logged to my web host's control

shocked when I saw this:

investigate.
