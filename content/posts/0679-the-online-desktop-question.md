title: The Online Desktop Question

I'm glad **Bryan Clark**
[poked](http://clarkbw.net/blog/2007/11/29/foundation-candidates-and-the-online-desktop-question/)
the candidates running for the GNOME Board about the Online Desktop
question. The best part was that he took the time to sift through all
the answers and derive a nice chart of what he understood from the
answers and what he felt needed some further explanation. So, to answer
his call...

I was stating like many of the other candidates that the Board should be
considered a bastion for the GNOME community, developers, contributors
and users. Working in unison as much as possible, it should provide the
support necessary to make sure ideas and projects come to fruition. I
repeat myself when I say that it should not get tangled up in the
intricacies of which languages to use but it should have an
understanding of the technologies in order to properly help delineate a
plan of action.

There was another question asked in the mailing list where I also point
out what the Board could do for the community:

I am very excited about the Online Desktop project, as well as other
technologies that will allow us to provide a smooth experience to our
users such as **PackageKit**, and as a member of the Board I will strive
to reach out to the developers (and community in general) to make sure
that ideas can be expressed, discussed, and resources can be properly
allocated. Since most of the candidates support the Online Desktop
project, no matter who gets elected to the 7 positions, the project and
the entire community can expect the Board to put its collective weight
behind it!
