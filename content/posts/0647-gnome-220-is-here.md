title: GNOME 2.20 is here!
---

[GNOME 2.20](http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/) just came out of
the oven and is as crispy as you'd expect it to be after a couple of
months of development! This is the second release I take part of (not as
a developer but as a translator), and want to take the opportunity to
thank all of those who participated in this effort!

I want to specially thank (and give a shout out to) the entire GNOME
i18n team! It is no easy task to go through (literally) thousands and
thousands of lines of messages, trying to translate them so not to lose
the true meaning of the sentence as well as make it clear and easy to
understand.

**We are the few... the proud... the exhausted!** :)

Bring on GNOME 2.22!

**UPDATE**: It seems that I got ahead of myself here... Since GNOME 2.20
released pretty much all of the tarballs yesterday AND Foresight Linux
had already everything compiled, I thought it was safe to blog about it
last night at around 23:55 UTC - 5. Apparently, tarballs are still
churning away and there hasn't been an official announcement yet.
Apologies for the confusion.
