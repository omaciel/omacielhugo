Just added a few more links to some of my favorite sites, visited
**every** single day, **religiously**! Where are Slashdot or OSNews you
may ask? I have become extremelly disappointed with the quality and
(lack of) variety of their articles. If you don't feel like looking
through the old list of links and try to figure out which ones are the
new ones, here they are:

1.  [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org/)
2.  [Planet Security](http://planetsecurity.bacarospo.net/)
3.  [Planet Ubuntu](http://planet.ubuntulinux.org/)

Some bloggers subscribe to multiple aggregators but you should have a
lot of good material to read during your morning hours.
