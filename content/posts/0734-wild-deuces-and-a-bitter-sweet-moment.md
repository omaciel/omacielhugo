title: Wild Deuces and a Bitter Sweet Moment
---

Today is a very special moment for all of those who were involved with
the
[release](http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.22/index.html.en)
of yet another stable GNOME, version **2.22**. It also marks the release
for another stable [Foresight Linux](http://www.foresightlinux.org/),
version **2**, keeping the tradition of always releasing together with
GNOME! That is a lot of number 2s! :) I want to congratulate everyone
who's helped for the last 6 months, specially the
[Brazilian](http://br.gnome.org/) translation team that once again
delivered a 100% translated GNOME desktop, and the Foresight guys for
delivering a great combination of bleeding edge technologies
(PulseAudio, PackageKit, Syslinux)!

It is also a day to remember the life of a friend from the Brazilian
team who passed away last year at the tender age of 24... **Raphael
Higino** was a long time contributor to the Brazilian GNOME team, a
reliable team member, and most of all a good friend! This new version of
GNOME has been dedicated to him and his acomplishments, an extremely
nice gesture from the entire GNOME community.

Thank you Raphael!
