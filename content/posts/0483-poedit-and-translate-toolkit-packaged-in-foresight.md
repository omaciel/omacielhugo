title: poEdit and translate-toolkit packaged in Foresight
---

Just finished packaging
[poEdit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/) and the
[translate-toolkit](http://translate.sourceforge.net/) for
[Foresight](http://foresightlinux.com/). I usually do my translations
using **Vim**, but ultimately use these two tools to "fine tune" them
before submiting them to bugzilla.

Speaking of translations, I cannot wait to see the new GNOME with
**100%** desktop translations in portuguese (Brazilian), thanks to a
partnership between the Brazilian
[GNOME](http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/pt_BR) and
[Ubuntu](https://beta.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-pt-br) translation
teams! ;)
