title: Epiphany Update
---

Ever since I wrote my last post about the state of Epiphany as the
default web browser for Gnome, I completely switched from Firefox to
it!Ã‚Â  Cold turkey!Ã‚Â  I must tell you, there are certain things which
can be annoying at times...Ã‚Â  But the sheer speed I have gained while
performing my web surfing "duties" is more than enough justification as
to why I will keep using it for now.Ã‚Â  Thanks to some great comments I
received, I am now subscribed to their mailing list and have solved some
of my initial issues by installing the epiphany-extensions package.Ã‚Â 
I still find the default behavior of newly created tabs (which will
always open your home page) annoying but the truth is I haven't
completely immersed myself yet and explored other venues for
information.Ã‚Â  I definitely see something here that has a lot of
potential!Ã‚Â  The volume of discussion in the mailing list has been
completely null for these last 14 days or so...Ã‚Â  I think I will add
Epiphany to my "evangelization" topics next time I talk to my friends...
