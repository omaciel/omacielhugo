Hey [Jonh](http://www.j5live.com/?p=350),
[Jono](http://www.jonobacon.org/?p=936),
[Lucas](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2007/04/04/0) et all. While
you're visiting Brazil during FISL, look for the **Ubuntu Brazilian
Team**. it should be easy to spot them... just look for the **loudest**
and **craziest** guys around!

Too bad I can't make it this year...
