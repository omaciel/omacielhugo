title: Announcing PhPlanet
---

It is with an enormous pleasure that I come to announce the birth of
[PhPlanet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet), the first (if I'm
not mistaken) 100% Open Source blog agregator written by a Brazilian for
Brazilians! Using the [Planet](http://planetplanet.org/) program as
source of inspiration,
[PhPlanet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet) already shows many
new features such as:

Web based administration:

-   Add feeds (authors)
-   Approve feeds enrolled for the site
-   Modify authors' information
-   Add, remove and/or edit Hackergotchis
-   Feeds (RSS and Atom)
-   Archiving of all posts for later retrieval (MySQL)
-   Registration of new feeds
-   Sending of posts via email (optional)...

For a complete list of the all innovations, check the project's [home
page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet) and take a look at the
live [demo](http://home.meyer.eti.br/planet/) page (sure, it is written
in portuguese but check out the functionality).

I had the priviledge of taking a peek at the source code and it is a
beauty! Congratulations for the excellent work MÃƒÂ¡rio!
