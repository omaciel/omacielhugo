I'm really loving this "war" between [Google](http://www.google.com) and
[Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com), battling to see who attracts more users.
I think we, the "middle man," will only gain in the end. Today Google
announced they're increasing everyone's [gmail](http://gmail.google.com)
account to a whopping **2GB**!!! Also, they've added the ability to
write emails using rich text features, such as: Bold, Italics,
Underline, Select a special font, Font Size, Font Color, Background
Color, Remove Formatting, Hyperlink Text, Numbered List, Bulleted List,
Indent Less, Indent More, Quote Text, Left Align, Center Align, Right
Align.

I say let them keep this going... Hope Microsoft will also put on their
gloves and present us with something that will sweep us off our feets!
;)

**Update:** The rollout seems to be moving right along... So far I'm up
to 1337MB! It seems to be in synch with the animated counter they have
on [gmail](http://gmail.google.com)\'s main site!
