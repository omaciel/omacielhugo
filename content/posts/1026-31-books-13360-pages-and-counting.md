[![My Book - Bound Edge by Kate
Elliot](http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2249857435_e52eb9c6ba-240x300.jpg)](http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2249857435_e52eb9c6ba.jpg)One
of my **New Year's resolution** for **2010** was the ambitious goal of
**reading one book for every week of the year**! In other words, to read
a total of **52 books** for 2010! I knew that it would be very hard to
complete this resolution without cheating and choosing thin books but I
figured: "[Aim for the moon, that way, even if you miss you'll still be
amongst the
stars!](http://www.quickandsimple.com/fun/inspirational-quotes/aim-moon)",
right?

It was around the middle of 2008 that I came up with a plan to "force"
myself to read a book every day. The reason I say "force" is because
since I sit in front of a computer all day long, it was really easy for
me to eat my lunch at my desk and surf the web, read news or spend time
on my pet projects. So I started visiting our public library and picking
up books (or sometimes putting a hold on books that were already out) I
found interesting. Then every day during my lunch break I'd lock my
computer screen and go downstairs to our building's lobby, sit on the
couch and read! In the beginning I often caught myself checking my email
or doing other things and not really focusing on the book. But after a
while doing this became second nature to my daily routine and now, even
during the weekend, I look forward to my "lunch break" so that I can sit
down, unplug, and dive into a nice book!

Early on 2010, spurred by all the feelings of change that a new year
brings, I decided I wanted to improve my lifestyle and enjoy life and my
family to the fullest. So I looked into books about happiness and
getting rid of bad and annoying habits. I also wanted to keep reading
about history, one of my favorite topics, specially about U.S. history.
Finally, I wanted to go back to reading some of the classics, those
books I've always wanted to read but felt that I didn't have enough time
for.

Interestingly enough, as the months progressed, I started gravitating
towards fiction and some of the newly published books, such as **Stieg
Larsson**\'s trilogy and even the entire **Harry Potter** saga!

With only a couple of weeks left until the end of the year, I have now
read a total of **31 books** and approximately **13360 pages** and still
have another book to finish, **Ken Follett**\'s [Fall of
Giants](http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Giants-Century-Trilogy-Follett/dp/0525951652/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1292335688&sr=1-1).
I also have a couple of other books I'd like to squeeze in before the
end of the year, but I may have to wait for our public library to get
them for me through their intralibrary load program. At the very top of
this list I have [The Lifecycle of Software
Objects](http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Software-Objects-Ted-Chiang/dp/1596063173/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1292335907&sr=1-1)
by **Ted Chiang,**[ ??The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional
and Personal
Life](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Possibility-Transforming-Professional-Personal/dp/0142001104/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=I110YH7R8US6S3&colid=32BX7VP2GEFI1)
by **Rosamund Stone Zander,** [The Thieves of
Manhattan](http://www.amazon.com/Thieves-Manhattan-Novel-Adam-Langer/dp/1400068916/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1292336128&sr=8-1)
by **Adam Langer**, and the new book my good friend **Pete Savage** is
secretly working on (the sequel to [Emblem
Divide](http://emblemdivide.com/) perhaps?)! :)
