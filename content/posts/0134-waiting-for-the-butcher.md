title: Waiting For The Butcher
---

Am here at my dad's awaiting the time for my surgery (scheduled for
later today at 2pm) and doing some surfing, thanks to some kind neighbor
and his/her open hot spot. ;) Brought (my dad) my old Lynksis router so
he can have some piece of mind against the kiddies. Will hopefully
switch to our own wi-fi soon...
