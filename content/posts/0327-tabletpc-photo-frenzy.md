As promissed, here are some pictures of my TabletPC running Ubuntu
Dapper.Ã‚Â  I have managed to use the graphical keyboard (from the
Assistive Technology Support submenu) in order to "type" using the
stylus pen, but it was "weird" having to "cherry pick" the letters.
;)Ã‚Â  Needless to say, I have removed it from the startup. I have
installedÃ‚Â  Nvidia's driver and everything is just peachy... haven't
figured out how to rotate the display yet though.

Following a tip, I tried to install xstroke, but it is not available for
Dapper yet.Ã‚Â  Anymore suggestions before I roll up my sleeves and get
my hands dirty with code?

Finally, I plugged my wife's iPod nano into it and Rhythmbox
automagically picked it up and I was able to play its contents with
style. ;)Ã‚Â  And without further delay... some pictures:

and finally, the real action taking place, Rhythmbox playing the iPod's
playlist:
