After several weeks agonizing over how to afford a trip to attend
**GUADEC 2010**, I have finally arrived at the conclusion that I won't
be able to make it. Due to my current financial situation and
obligations as a father of two, it would be unrealistic to hop on a
plane and go to this event right now for me. Unfortunately none of the
organizations I approached were able to offer me any type of financial
support, understandable due to today's economy issues.

I want to thank the amazing crew behind the **GNOME Travel Committee**
for a very generous offer and for being so patient and allowing me to
take a bit of time to make my decision.

I also want to thank the **organizers** for choosing my presentation and
keeping me updated with the tentative schedule for the event. I'm really
sorry I won't be able to present it and I can only hope that someone
else can fill in the vacancy.

Finally, I wish you all a wonderful event and I will be watching from
the sidelines for the many amazing things that are sure to come out of
GUADEC.
