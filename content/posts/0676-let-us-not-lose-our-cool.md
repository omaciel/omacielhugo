title: Let us not lose our cool
---

About today's
[outburst](http://www.murrayc.com/blog/permalink/2007/11/26/gnome-board-2007-candidates-the-bad/),
I have the following to say: The **GNOME Foundation** has established a
democratic process by which its members and directions can be chosen. If
a process or person has not delivered that which was agreed upon or
expected (due to a role), that is the price one pays for democracy.
Please, let us not lose out cool and take advantage of the system to do
what is right for the Foundation. By all means, voice your opinion...
but let us all keep our cool.

who are kindly asking Murray to retract his comments and use this year's
elections to really voice his opinion.
