A big thanks goes to my friend
[SuperToadman](http://www.supertoadman.com/cs/blogs/supertoadman/archive/2005/09/20/4152.aspx)
for blogging about Steve Jobs' [commencement
address](http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html)
to Stanford's Class of 2005 graduates delivered on this past June 12,
2005. It talks among several things about loving what you do... About
being able to look back on your life and "connect the dots..." To make
every day of your life count!!! Needless to say I completely agree with
what he said and am desperately looking for a way to follow what my
heart urges me to do!

> You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as
> it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your
> life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe
> is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you
> do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with
> all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
