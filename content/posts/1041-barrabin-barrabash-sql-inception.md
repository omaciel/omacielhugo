Remember my [last post](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1324) about the comic
strip my friend [Karlisson Bezerra](http://nerdson.com/blog/) created to
explain how **Creative Commons** licenses work? Well, over this weekend
I was talking to him and offered to translate one of my favorite strips
to English (here's the
[original](http://nerdson.com/blog/sql-inception/) in Brazilian
Portuguese). I always get a kick out of this one and hope you'll enjoy
it too!
