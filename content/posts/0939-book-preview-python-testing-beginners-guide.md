I was looking for some material on proper **python testing** in order to
improve my **QA** skills and after some "Googling" came across "[Python
Testing: Beginner's Guide](http://bit.ly/PythonTestingBook)". My first
impulse was to hit **Amazon** and see if they had it and if I could buy
an **ebook** version. Sadly, they only had the "dead tree" version, so I
decided to check if the publisher, [PackT
Publishing](http://packtpub.com), had an alternative.

Boy, was I glad I hit their web site! Not only there was an ebook
version of that book, but they **do not password protect** them, giving
you complete control over your purchase!!! You can also**copy tex**t
from it, which makes your life really easy when you're following along
and want to copy some of the code being described!

Needless to say I purchased the ebook version and have already allocated
my weekend to read it, so you can expect a review next week. In the
meantime, here's a free chapter (PDF) for you to get a taste for the
book: [Chapter 5: When Doctest isn't Enough: Unittest to the
Rescue](http://bit.ly/PythonTestingCh5)
