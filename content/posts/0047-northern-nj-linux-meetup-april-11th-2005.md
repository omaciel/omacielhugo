title: Northern NJ Linux MeetUp - April 11th, 2005
---

This month's [Northern NJ Linux MeetUp](http://linux.meetup.com/8/)
meeting had the highest attendance so far since I became the organizer:
7, including myself and our guest speaker
[Mako](http://mako.yukidoke.org/). He was kind enough to accept my
invitation to visit and tell us about his work with Ubuntu and Debian
Linux. I think everyone had a good time! Mako seems to be a really nice
guy and was more than willing to answer our questions. At the end of the
night I drove him back across the G.W. Bridge and extended an invitation
for a repeat in the near future.
