[posts](http://triplehelix.org/blog/2005/04/28/plug-audioscrobbler/) of
people talking about [Audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.com)
today and decided to see what the noise was all about.

> Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin
> for your media player (Winamp, iTunes, [XMMS](http://www.xmms.org/),
> [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/), etc..). Plugins send the
> name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which
> updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a
> plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening
> statistics. The system automatically matches you to people with a
> similar music taste, and generates personalised recommendations.

Note that [XMMS](http://www.xmms.org/) and
[foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) are both supported! :)
