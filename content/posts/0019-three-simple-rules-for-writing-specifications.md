title: Three Simple Rules For Writing Specifications
---

[Jakub Steiner](http://jimmac.musichall.cz/weblog.php) from [Planet
Gnome](http://planet.gnome.org) mentioned an old article written by
[Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com) on the importance of
writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very
light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time
to absorb his "pearls of wisdom." It doesn't matter if you're a
programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of
possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an
angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure
all your snacks are within reach so you don't have to miss your favorite
soap. Joel's main reasons for learning to incorporate specifications
into your work habits can be summed up by the following 3 simple rules
(in no specific order):

1.  *when you design your product in a human language, it only takes a
    few minutes to try thinking about several possibilities, revising,
    and improving your design.*
2.  *When you write a spec, you only have to communicate how the program
    is supposed to work once.*
3.  *without a detailed spec, it's impossible to make a schedule.*

Don't just take my word for it and read the
