title: Switching from SourceForge to Google Code
---

For the last 2 weeks I have (unsuccesfully) tried to migrate
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org) from SourceForge
to [Google Code](http://code.google.com/hosting/) project hosting. I
have filled out the web form to register a new project on Google Code,
but since this project already exists in SourceForge, I have to go
through an extra step where a message should be sent to the project lead
(which happens to be me) requesting approval for this migration. The
problem is that I always get a 500 page when I click on the submit
button!

There is definitely something borked in this process, for when I first
tried to go through this process, I would some times see a captcha box
above the button... and sometimes I wouldn't! Regardless of whether I
saw (and obviously filled) the captcha field, I always ended up with the
500 error page.

Both of my emails to their
<google-code-hosting-reservations@googlegroups.com> contact email have
gone unanswered... No luck asking on \#google at Freenode either. So...
anyone from [Google](http://www.google.com) reading this post who can
lend me a hand?
