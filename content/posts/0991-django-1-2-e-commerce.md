ï»¿ï»¿Just received my complimentary copy of the book "[Django
1.2 E-Commerce](http://www.packtpub.com/django-1-2-e-commerce-build-powerful-applications/book?utm_source=ogmaciel.com&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_003454)\"
from [Packt Publishing](http://packtpub.com)! From the book's overview
page:

-   Build all the components for an e-commerce store, from product
    catalog to shopping cart to checkout processor
-   Build a high quality e-commerce site quickly and start making money
-   All the examples in the book will run smoothly for all the versions
    of Django 1.x
-   Follow a tutorial format to build many components from scratch while
    leveraging the open-source community to enhance functionality

You can expect a book review by next week, but in the meantime, here's a
