title: "From the \\\"Useful Django Tip\\\" Department: Reset The Admin
  Password"
---

This comes straight from the **Useful Django Tip** department: How do
you reset the admin password for a Django project when you've forgotten
it?

[Bruce
Kroeze](http://coderseye.com/2007/howto-reset-the-admin-password-in-django.html)
suggested using Django's shell to resolve this common issue and one of
the comments his post received nailed it:

``` {.python}
[omaciel@crutches souschef]$ python manage.py shell
Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Mar 22 2010, 10:30:12)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 0.10 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
?Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
%quickref -> Quick reference.
helpÂ Â Â Â Â  -> Python's own help system.
object?Â Â  -> Details about 'object'. ?object also works, ?? prints more.

In [1]: from django.contrib.auth.models import User

In [2]: u = User.objects.get(username__exact="admin")

In [3]: u.set_password('whatever');

In [4]: u.save()
```

Thatâ€™s it!
