The [Foresight Linux](http://www.foresightlinux.org) team is looking for
a good **graphic designer** to help them with a **splash screen**!

**Foresight Linux,**a desktop operating system featuring an intuitive
user interface and a showcase of the latest desktop software" is now
gearing for a major release with all the latest and greatest
applications out there!

Would you like to see your art work distributed and displayed whenever
someone boots **Foresight Linux**? If so, please drop me a line for more
information!
