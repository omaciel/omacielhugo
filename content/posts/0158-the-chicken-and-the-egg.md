title: The Chicken and the Egg

During one of those lucid moments of spontaneous philosophical
discussions I have with my wife while driving to work, I came up with
the following question:

Assuming you follow Christianity's point of view about the creation of
the world and human kind, you most likely know that God gave life to
Adam and Eve, Earth's first inhabitants. They proceeded to follow his
advice of propagating the race and gave birth to 3 kids (I believe they
were all of masculine gender). Now there were a total of 5 inhabitants.
How do you then explain the process by which the entire planet became
populated when there were no other, how can I put this without being
politically incorrect, available females to complement the procreative
process?

All religious zealots are welcome to refrain from replying. This is a
purely logical question and all replies **will** be screened for flaming
and useless feedback.
