[Radio Tray](http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/), your favorite light
weight online radio streaming application, has gone under some more
development churn since its last release. Namely, there is now a **dbus
interface** to allow other applications to interact with it! So you
write a "remote control" for Radio Tray and change the volume, change
stations, extract metadata from the stream being played, etc. Here's
what's currently supported:

-   listRadios()
-   getCurrentRadio()
-   playRadio(name)
-   turnOff()
-   volumeUp()
-   volumeDown()
-   getCurrentMetaData()

Fancy learning a bit about adding a dbus interface to your own
application? Want to add new features to Radio Tray? A new
"**testdbus.py**\" script has been added to the repository to help you
understand how things work and get you to hit the ground running! Just
clone the repository and take a peek:

`hg clone http://radiotray.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/radiotray/radiotray`

Oh, and if you can help us **translate it into different languages**,
join our [effort](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/radiotray/) and
start helping today!
