My last post brought in a few interesting replies, the great majority of
them showing support (somewhat) to the idea of unifying the Ubuntu name.
While I let the caffeine surge do the talking toward the end of the
post, I should have added the following statement to completely close my
argument:

I'm not suggesting that we stop manufacturing/shipping/distributing the
other "flavors" of Ubuntu in the form of CDs and downloads. All I'm
saying is that instead of having the names Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Xubuntu,
etc in their covers, we name them all **Ubuntu Desktop**! The title
would also contain, directly below the main title, the type of window
manager installed by default. The end user would then see Ubuntu
Desktop: KDE Edition, for instance. The advantage(?) of this approach is
that we'll keep the same brand across the many variants.

So this could solve any possible identity crisis with the brand name...
but in my oppinion, it doesn't solve the confusion that having different
window managers could cause to someone who has just decided to switch to
GNU/Linux.

Now comes the part where I drink some more coffee and pitch the idea of
a "uhhh... show me the pretty colors" interface that would at least give
the user a glimpse of what their desktop "could look like". My friend

I sort of envision a mechanism pretty much like those that let you see
what a new theme would look like in my WordPress blog... or the way
ObConf lets me see what my desktop will look like when I choose a
different theme... It doesn't install anything but let's you have a
glimpse of what it could look like.

As far as not having enough space in the disk, don't we currrently
install OpenOffice (or is it the language-pack for it?) via a sshfs
during the first boot?
