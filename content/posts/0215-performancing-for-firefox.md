title: Performancing for Firefox
---

The other day I was bragging about the new plugin for Firefox 1.5,
[Performancing](http://performancing.com/firefox). In a nut shell, it
allows you to compose and edit blog posts inside your Firefox tabs. It
pretty much supports all the major blog protocols out there and it has a
neat interface. Since I use my [Portable
Firefox](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/browsers/portable_firefox)
1.5 a lot, this little gem works just perfect for me on the go!
