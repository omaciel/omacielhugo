title: More Material For My Thesis
---

My [previous](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=100) post talked about how our
lives are getting registered in the internet, free for everyone and
anyone to see. Today I learned about [this
site](http://postsecret.blogspot.com/) which has only strengthened my
"thesis."

> *\"is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their
> secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard.\"*

Some of these so called postcards are the scariest things I've seen
online in quite some time... Rather disturbing...
