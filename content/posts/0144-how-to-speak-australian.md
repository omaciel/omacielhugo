*\[Australian outback background music plays\]*

\[Announcer\] How to speak Australian...

*\[Husband and wife are seen doing their laundry... doing their food
shopping... cleaning / dusting their house... cooking and feeding their
kid... all shown in fast motion\]*

*\[pause\]*

\[Announcer\] **Day off**!

It occured to me while replying to a friend's post that we New
Jersey(ians)/Yorker(ers) seem to live by a different drum beat! Lately
I've been hearing stories of people doing a lot of fun stuff and/or
taking the time to read... or just nap... or just watch their toes nail
grow! Meanwhile, it's the rat race for us over here!
