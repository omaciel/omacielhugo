title: 365 Days of Captivity
---

Yesterday I completed my first year of work at this NYC departmental
agency... That's 365 days of 2-3 hours commute... approximately \$11
parking, \$10.50 tolls daily... 365 days having to buy this watered
down, taste-like-piss liquid they insist in calling coffee... 365 days
of being constantly reminded (directly and indirectly) that I don't
belong here and am "just a consultant" with no rights or say in
anything... and worse of all, 365 days of getting home very tired and
not being able to enjoy the few hours I have (from around 7pm to 10pm)
with my young daughter and wife!

A big thanks goes to all those
[assholes](http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/JAVA/election2004/) who chose
to elect our current president for yet another 4-years term! I wonder if
you are all enjoying listening to the daily reports of our troops dying
in a foreign land for a stupid *war over oil*... or if you admired how
*promptly* our government came to the rescue of all the folks down in
New Orleans... or if they feel good in seeing our economy going down the
gutter...

An they call America a "first world country."
