title: You got the medicine that can cure my disease
---

After the first shock-wave caused by the announcement of [Google
Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) and the lack of a client for
non-Microsoft operating systems, I'm glad to inform that you'll be able
to join in the fun using some of the other supported open source
clients. Since I use [Gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) for all my
instant messenger needs,
[here](http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073)\'s
the info on how to set it up.
