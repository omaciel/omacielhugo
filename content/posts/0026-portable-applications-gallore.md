Wow!!! It didn't take me a long time to come up with a pretty good list
of some slick programs you can run off of a portable device! Here's what
I've come up with so far:

-   [Portable
    Firefox](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox/)
-   [Portable
    Sunbird](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_sunbird/)
-   [Portable
    Thunderbird](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_thunderbird/)
-   [Portable NVU](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_nvu/)
-   [Trillian Anywhere](http://www.trilliananywhere.com/index.html)

I'm still missing a good media player!!!
