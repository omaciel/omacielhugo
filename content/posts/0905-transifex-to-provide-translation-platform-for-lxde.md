The [LXDE](http://lxde.org) project has announced that it will use the
[Transifex](http://www.transifex.org/) platform to allow their users to
better manage their workflow, provide up to the minute data and
statistics, and lower their administrative workload. The full
announcement can be found [here](http://blog.lxde.org/?p=336).

It was a real pleasure to work along side **Martin Bagge, Mario Behling,
Dimitris Glezos, Diego BÃºrigo ZacarÃ£o and Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams** and
get this partnership in place. Expect a lot of good things coming from
both projects!
