title: So you want to sell open source
---

I wanted to write about the concept of selling open source ideas and
what are some of the required criteria for being successful in doing it
for quite some time, and [Stormy](http://stormyscorner.com/)\'s
[comment](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=663#comment-4704) on my last post
sort of pushed me to it.

I use the word "sell" here not strictly in the sense of a financial
transaction but also in the sense of getting your open source product to
be adopted and have a better chance at standing out from the huge pool
of available open source software. These last 3 years have showed me
that what we today call "popular" open source software display a couple
of distinct patterns, some of which seem to also be shared with other
open source products that are distributed with some type of financial
payback. So, without much further ado, here are some of my observations:

-   Your "product" **must** be available for the Ubuntu distribution.
    There is no doubt that Ubuntu is the most popular desktop GNU/Linux
    distribution and there are no signs of that changing any time soon.
    If you want people to use your product, make sure you have it
    properly packaged for Ubuntu. Bonus points for RPMs too!
-   It should be localized to other languages. When we're talking about
    massive contracts such as those done by government agencies and
    larger institutes or departments, and I quote Stormy here, "having
    localized versions of the product can be a deciding factor for
    companies looking to include GNOME technologies in their products,
    like custom netbook distros." More follows on my next point.
-   Corporations should invest in open source communities. For instance,
    say that company **Foo** wants to sell device **Bar** to the
    education department of country **Zing**. Let's say this device will
    run **LXDE**andwill be distributed to young children of Zing whose
    first language is **Zong**. Don't you think that Foo will have a
    better chance of getting a contract with Zing if their devices are
    100% translated to Zong? Also, wouldn't make sense for Foo to invest
    some (probably tax deductible) money into a project's translation
    team so to give back to the community, and moreover, get (hopefully)
    quicker return in their investment?
-   Documentation must also be localized. This includes web sites,
    forums, FAQs, etc and goes hand to hand with my previous
    observation.
-   Have a clear process for offering some type of support. Having a
    great product is only half of the battle if you want to make it
    appealing to "investors". But in order to secure a good relationship
    with them it is necessary to have a clear and structured process for
    offering technical support. Obviously most open source projects are
    all volunteer based and there is no "support team" per se, but
    having some type of issue tracking system and a FAQ section
    somewhere intuitive in your project's web site is a good start.
    Investors need to know that in case something arises, issues can be
    "escalated" to people who will be more knowledgeable on how to
    handle them.
-   Release soon, release often. Stay on top of your issues and make
    sure that there is a constant feedback flow between those who report
    them and those who are looking into them.Â  Have a clear and well
    stated roadmap available and make sure that your users know when to
    expect an update or upgrade.

Well, there are some of the things I could remember during my lunch
break. As I am not a business person nor have I ever sold anything in my
life, some of these observations may not be relevant to the real world.
I'd be very much interested to learn what other people think about this
subject and what personal exeperiences you may want to share?
