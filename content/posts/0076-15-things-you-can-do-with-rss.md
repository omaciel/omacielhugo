I didn't know you could do all of these with rss!!! Wow!!! Read the
original post [here](http://timyang.com/comments.php?id=630_0_1_0_C).

Get the news as it happens from multiple news sources

:   An RSS feed reader is an aggregator of numerous feeds from news
    sources (and nearly every major paper and TV news network has RSS
    feeds today). But now there are even feeds that aggregate other
    feeds. The new [RSSmix.com](http://rssmix.com/) lets you combine all
    the news source RSS feeds into one single feed so you get news as it
    happens.

Collect your email from all your email accounts in your RSS reader

:   Easily done with [mailbucket.org](http://www.mailbucket.org/). And
    each [Gmail account has an RSS
    feed](http://forevergeek.com/geek_resources/gmail_rss_feed.php) too.
    Or if you're a user of [Mailinator.com](http://mailinator.com/),
    then you'll be glad there's a similar service called
    [dodgeit.com](http://dodgeit.com/) but with RSS feeds.

Track Fedex packages

:   [Ben Hammersley
    says](http://www.benhammersley.com/tools/fedex_package_tracking_in_rss.html)
    Just add your tracking number to the end of a special RSS feed
    address.

Get notified of bargains at Ebay

:   [RSSauction.com](http://www.rssauction.com/) lets you specify the
    type of product, its description and even the price range in their
    customised Ebay feeds.

Get stock updates

:   There have been various paid services and limited unpaid ticker
    services around. [Tim Bray made a customisable
    feed](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/27/RSSticker).
    Yahoo is introducing its own [RSS ticker
    service](http://ticker.yahoo.com/).

Get the weather reports

:   [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) has the weather
    of every city and town in the world. And each of them now has an RSS
    feed. Alternatively, there is
    [RSSweather.com](http://www.rssweather.com/).

Find out what people are saying about you, your company or your product online

:   Services like [technorati.com](http://technorati.com) and
    [pubsub.com](http://pubsub.com/) offer something that's popularly
    called persistent search delivery. You type in a search term such as
    your name and or your company name or product name and they will
    return the newest indexed references to you in a customised RSS
    feed. Both services scan blogs. If you want persistent search
    delivery from a broader range of sites, you have
    [Googlealert.com](http://www.googlealert.com/).

Get music, radio programs and TV clips

:   Now you have podcasts and directories like
    [podcastalley.com](http://www.podcastalley.com/) that also serve the
    latest podcasts in several RSS feeds. And increasingly, like [Comedy
    Central's Daily
    Show](http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/browsevideos.jhtml?s=ds),
    broadcasters are finding it effective to promote and deliver their
    shows in RSS. Videobloggers now have a community website called
    [Mcfeedia.com](http://mefeedia.com/) that adds tags to video blog
    RSS feeds.

Stay updated on someone's schedule

:   [RSScalendar.com](http://rsscalendar.com/) lets someone input new
    events and meetings on their schedule for free. And if you pick up
    the RSS feed for that schedule, you're always up-to-date on what's
    going on in that person's day.

Get cinema schedule updates

:   Quietly getting popular, a movement led by small local cinemas like
    [City Cinema](http://www.citycinema.net/), rather than big cinema
    networks. But the bigger cinemas are delivering updates via email
    and these can be converted into feeds by mailbucket.org.

Read your favourite comics

:   Many daily and weekly comic authors publish online and have an RSS
    feed. [Dilbert](http://dilbert.com/) of course has one. Best way to
    locate the feed is to type in the name of the comic into either
    [Feedster.com](http://feedster.com/) or
    [Bloglines.com](http://bloglines.com/) (both are great RSS feed
    directories). And even if your favourite comic doesn't have a feed
    on its website, a good comic will have someone somewhere creating an
    unofficial scraped feed.
    [Comicalert.com](http://www.comicalert.com/) has a large updated
    list of both official and unofficial RSS feed list of hundreds of
    comics.

Find out what other people surfing

:   I don't mean spyware. A lot of people use online bookmarks which
    they make public. Places like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/),
    [feedmarker.com](http://feedmarker.com/),
    [furl.net](http://furl.net/) and the new
    [wists.com](http://wists.com/) are online bookmark services that
    create RSS feeds for each user.

Automatically backup your weblog posts

:   If your RSS feed is being picked up by an online feed reader service
    like [Bloglines.com](http://bloglines.com/), they will store all
    your entries on their server. Unfortunately, they don't have an
    export feature. But at least all your entries (if you have full
    entries in your RSS feed) are safe and dated.

Get software updates

:   Popular software downloads sites like
    [Download.com](http://download.com/) and
    [versiontracker.com](http://versiontracker.com/) let you keep up
    with all new releases via RSS. So you can also be alerted when your
    favourite softwares have a new version or when there are better
    releases.

Get the latest bittorrent files and ahem, p\*rn

:   As they say, if its worth something, it's worth more illegal.
    Bittorrent directory [Torrentspy.com](http://torrentspy.com/) was
    the first to have an RSS feed that lets its users know what has just
    been uploaded. And the online p\*rn industry, being always on the
    cutting edge of online business, was probably the first to take to
    blog CMSes and use them to generate traffic through RSS feeds. I'll
    refrain from linking to one here, but it just takes a Google search
    to find several.
