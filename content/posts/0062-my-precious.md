title: "My Precious..."

I have finally found my portable MP3 and OGG player to use on the go
with my Seagate 40GB disk (which I have nicknamed Pegasus):
[Billy](http://www.sheepfriends.com/?page=billy)! I downloaded the setup
file and chose my Pegasus as the destination folder. I then chose one of
the several music folders I have inside Pegasus and started listening to
my songs immediately. The program seems to have been written for those
of us who hate using the mouse and rather use keyboard shortcuts. The
system requirements are pretty low as well:

-   133MHz Pentium I or comparable
-   32MB RAM
-   1MB Hard Disk Space
-   16bit Sound Card
-   Windows 98
-   DirectX 3

There's no stinking skin or fancy eye candy either. I think I can
finally remove [WinAmp](http://www.winamp.com) from my computer at work!
