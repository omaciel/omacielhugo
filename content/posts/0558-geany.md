Last week I started using the text editor and IDE
[Geany](http://geany.uvena.de/) for the first time, and I was pleasantly
surprised with it! Obviously, there's a pretty big number of text
editors out there that with the "right" number of enabled would turn an
ordinary editor to a super-on-steroids IDE, but I felt Geany to be a
very light and fast option, with a couple of nice features already
enabled by default.

For instance, there's a class browser on the left hand panel that allows
you to easily access functions, methods and properties in your code with
a single click. Coupled with the ability to expand/collapse sections of
your code (like a XML editor), Geany has definitely earned some more
"testing time" bot at home and work!
