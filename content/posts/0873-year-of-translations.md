title: Year of Translations?
---

What a great month for open source translators this has been! The latest
news is the marriage of GNOME's [Damn Lies](http://l10n.gnome.org) with
[Vertimus](https://launchpad.net/vertimus). You can think of it as
statistics and work flow in one interface! From the announcement email:

> You like Damned Lies and Vertimus, we too, so we have merged both! The
> new Damned Lies offers a new reviewing workflow. If you're a
> translator, you can join one or many teams and reserve a module for
> translation. Once your work is ready, you can upload the PO file
> on[http://l10n.gnome.org](http://l10n.gnome.org/) and then a reviewer
> of this team will review yourwork for approval. A committer is still
> required to eventually commit the file in the GNOME SVN. DL is able to
> send an email to your team mailing list to notify about important
> actions. The goal is to promote good translations and to help
> newcomers with advices so the team coordinator is able to assign new
> roles to the team members (as reviewer or committer).

Could 2009 be the Year of Translations? Expect a follow up post
explaining what this marriage means to you soon.
