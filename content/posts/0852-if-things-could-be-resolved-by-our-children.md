title: If things could be resolved by our children
---

Something interesting happened today. As my wife and I talked about the
economic bailout during dinner, we didn't notice that Yv, my
soon-to-be-seven-year-old was paying close attention to what we were
saying. The following is a pretty close description of the dialogue that
followed:

-   **Yv**: ... where are they getting US\$700?
-   **Me**: They're taking the mine from us and every other family.
-   **Yv**: Have they asked you if it is ok to do it?
-   **Me**: Not really...
-   **Yv**: But that's **stealing**! Can they be **arrested**?

At which point I had no answer to give her...
