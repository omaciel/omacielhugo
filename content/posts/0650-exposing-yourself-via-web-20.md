title: Exposing yourself via Web 2.0
---

Interesting how it is relatively easy to follow what someone is
[reading](http://digg.com/users/OgMaciel),
[listening](http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/user/OgMaciel/recenttracks.rss),
[going/seeing](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=25563799@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom),
all via RSS. If you have a
[Mugshot](http://mugshot.org/xml/userRSS?who=cTTX4b43QgBrZ3) account and
their client installed, then it is even easier to follow this
information. I've learned of different bands/music thanks to these
feeds. I only use a couple of these "social networking" sites, so you
could only imagine how much more information is available out there.
