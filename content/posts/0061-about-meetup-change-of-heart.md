title: About MeetUp Change of Heart
---

Recently [MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com), a then **free** group
organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its
services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay \$19 a month to use
their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for
the [Northern NJ Linux Meetup](http://linux.meetup.com/8/) I'm somewhat
saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean the end of
the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we've had so far (with
the exception of the day I brought someone from
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org) Linux to gives us a talk... that
day we had 7 members!), it just doesn't make sense for me to fork out
the money. I've been toying with the idea of starting my own Linux User
Group but it seems to me that:

-   There aren't enough Linux enthusiasts in Northern NJ;
-   People don't feel the need to get together and "geek-out" once a
    month;

I have posted a final note on our board urging people to come out of the
Linux closet and make themselves heard. If by next week I don't hear
anything I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to resign. :-
