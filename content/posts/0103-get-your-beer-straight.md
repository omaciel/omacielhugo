title: Get Your Beer Straight
---

I've been known to drink "socially" a few beers here and there but I
must confess that I don't really know much about the subject. I often
rely on my taste buds OR how warm the weather is and how cold the beer
is. But alas! I have just found this great
[site](http://www.beeradvocate.com/) which will tell you all about
pretty much any beer out there along with usefull reviews and
definitions. So if you don't know the difference between a
[Schwarzbier](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/31/), a
[Pilsener](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/41/), and a
[Stout](http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/158/), then your problems
are now over.
