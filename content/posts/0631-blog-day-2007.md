I have just received the news from [Walter
Cruz](http://devlog.waltercruz.com/) that he chose the Brazilian
Portuguese version of my blog as one of his favorites for this year's
[Blog Day 2007](http://www.blogday.org/)! I was very pleased and honored
for being selected by such a great guy! ;)

So I'll join in the fun and will announce a couple of my favorite
Brazilian blogs. Just a little display that Brazilians have much more to
offer than Carnaval, beautifull women, and soccer players:

1.  [Blog AurÃƒÂ©lio Verde](http://aurelio.wordpress.com/): I really
    enjoy AurÃƒÂ©lio's laid back style and stories!
2.  [Fudeblog](http://zyakannazio.eti.br/fudeblog/): Yet another diverse
    and fun blog by CÃƒÂ©sar Cardoso!
3.  [Simples IdÃƒÂ©ias, por Nando Vieira](http://simplesideias.com.br/)
    is one of my favorite blogs to catch up on programming tips, with
    the right amount of tips and code.
4.  [Nerdson nÃƒÂ£o vai ÃƒÂ  escola](http://www.nerdson.com/blog/) is a
    Brazilian comic strip that always makes me laugh!
5.  [SÃƒÂ©rgio Rafael Lemke](http://sergiorafael.wordpress.com/)\'s blog
    has served as a valuable reference for those times someone asks me
    how to get Ubuntu to perform tricks !

Unfortunately I don't know their emails right off the top of my head
(you're supposed to let them know about your selection, but I'm sure
they'll "bump" into this post somehow. :)
