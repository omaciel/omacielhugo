title: Now That You've Found Love What Are You Gonna Do?
---

Now that you have downloaded and installed the latest [Foresight Linux
2.5
release](http://www.foresightlinux.org/release/announcing-foresight-linux-2-5-0/),
here are a couple of things you may want to do:

-   **Update Your System**: Since Foresight has a rolling release
    schedule, we already have updates for you, including and newer
    **MPlayer** with support for **Blue-Ray**!Â 

    > Run *sudo conary updateall*

-   **Install Chromium web browser**: Try this pretty cool web browser
    made by **Google**. Got a **gMail** account? Take advantage of the
    bookmarks and password synchronization feature and have it all
    seamlessly integrated!

    > Run *sudo conary update chromium*

-   **Install Hotot** and keep up with your friends on **Twitter**!

    > Run *sudo conary update hotot*

-   **Rock out with Spotify** and enjoy a great music service!

    > Run *sudo conary update spotify*

-   **Terminator** is one of the very first things I install on my
    systems and if you rely on using a solid and feature-filled terminal
    like I do, you will definitely install it too!

    > Run *sudo conary update terminator*

-   Speaking of **must haves** my list would be incomplete with out
    installing **Dropbox**! I keep all of my "dot" files such as vimrc
    and bashrc in a directory hosted by Dropbox and then symlink them in
    my systems so that whenever I make any change to one of them, the
    change is propagated instantaneously to my other systems.

    > Run *sudo conary update nautilus-dropbox*

Obviously, feel free to drop by **\#foresight** on **freenode** and let
us know what you think of Foresight and how we can improve your
experience! **Your Distro Should Be Cool!**
