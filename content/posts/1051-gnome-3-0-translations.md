Hey, are you feverishly working on the **translation** for the upcoming
**GNOME 3.0** release? Do you find yourself often wondering how a
certain word was translated across the entire desktop applications?
Well, I do and this is why I developed
[Pylyglot](http://www.pylyglot.org), a **Django**-driven localization
tool that let's you search for a word and see how it has been translated
for a given language. The plan is to have fresh data straight from the
GNOME **git** repositories every Monday for now, eventually switching to
a more frequent update schedule.

Right now I'm getting a 500 error when you click on the list of packages
for a certain word, but I hope I can fix it over this weekend. There is
an [issue](https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot/issues/23) filed for it,
and if you have the time and interest in helping me fix it or
suggestions (and patches) to improve the overall experience, please
[fork](https://github.com/omaciel/pylyglot) the project and come chat
with me on **\#pylyglot** on **freenode:**

Happy translations!
