title: April Fool Jokes

Ha! [Planet Gnome](http://planet.gnome.org) and [Planet
KDE](http://www.planetkde.org) have played their April Fools trick on me
today. Apparently they've switched their DNS entries (or whatever it is
that is required) so that people visiting Planet Gnome will be directed
to Planet KDE (but the URL still says planet.gnome.org) and vice-versa!
I refreshed my page a couple of times untill I realized what had
happened! Good one guys!

**Update:** Just noticed that [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org/)
has changed their Debian logo for an
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/)\'s.
