Or something like that!Ã‚Â  My buddy [Ken
Vandine](http://ken.vandine.org) will be this year at the
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) booth at **OSCON**. If you're around, stop
by to say hi, learn more about GNOME,
[Foresight](http://www.foresightlinux.org), and get some swag, like the
GNOME LiveCDs! ;)

By the way, did you notice Foresight's new flashy logo?

(apparently Flickr didn't like the transparent background?)
