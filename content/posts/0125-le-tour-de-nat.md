---

Very amusing [play-by-play](http://rlove.org/log/2005071601) recount of
[Nat Friedman](http://www.nat.org/)\'s adventorous attempt to travel
from his hometown of Boston to the very tip of Cape Cod by bike! The
reason: Insanity could be a great part of it, but apparently he just
wants to prove [someone](http://joeshaw.org/) wrong. Apparently Nat has
to make it back to Boston for a party later the same evening. Updated
every so often with pictures, videos, and witty comments. A must!
