title: Translating Ubuntu Breezy
---

Early this week I decided to lure more people into participating more
with the task of translating Ubuntu Breezy's packages to the Portuguese
(Brazilian) language. A quick email to our distribution
[BrazilianLoCo](mailto:%20ubuntu-br@lists.ubuntu.com) list with promises
of eternal gratitude from \$DEITY was able to attract a few replies and
by Tuesday (or was it Monday???) night I met up with a few people at
\#ubuntu-br (Freenode) who were willing to spend some time doing the
job.

I must tell you... we were able to get a lot accomplished that night!
And the repercussion of that night seemed to have sent "after-shock"
waves across the community, for the effort is still ongoing and more
people joined in the effort!

I just have got to mention [Bruno
Lima](https://launchpad.net/people/bslima19) and [MÃƒÂ¡rio
Meyer](https://launchpad.net/people/mariomeyer), two great guys who are
responsible for doing a whole lot of work in such a short time AND
attract more people to the cause!

Looking forward to continue working with you and beat you in our little
translation race! ;)
