About 2 weekends ago I had the privilege of meeting up with my good
friend Supertoadman at a diner! He had come down to my neck of the woods
to visit his "special friend" and managed to take some time off to hang
out. We mostly talked about our last camping trip and, as expected,
about computers! He ended up picking up the tab, which made me wish I
had order the filet mignon! ;)
