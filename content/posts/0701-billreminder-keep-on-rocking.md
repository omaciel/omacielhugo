[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) now has **inline
searching** and **colored categories** for (hopefully) easier sorting
and some bling. :) A few more issues have been closed as well, bringing
us closer and closer to a code freeze.

Also, thanks to **Diogo Autilio** and **Alex Bevilacqua** we now have
BillReminder packaged for **Ubuntu Gutsy**! Please take
[them](http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/) (there are 2 \*.debs
available) for a spin and relate any bugs or feature requests
[here](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161428).
