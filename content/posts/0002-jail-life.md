No word about
getting a copy of my database backup yet... In the meantime, here's a
(mug) shot of my at my so called "prison cell." Been here for almost 6
months and haven't gotten used to living in this "cubicle forest" yet.
The inhabitants are a bit edgy and can turn to cannibals without any
warning. Boy, am I glad that Tux is here to protect me (that's him
sitting atop my pc).
