It's been a while since I last wrote anything, mostly due to a few new
changes that happened these last 3 weeks or so. Here's a small list of
some of the things that I can remember right now:

-   My pet project
    [BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) is now
    hosted in the GNOME SVN repository! It took me a while to get the
    right resources and free time to migrate everything, but I believe
    that it is now completed. The source code can be checked out from
    [here](http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/billreminder/) and issues can be
    filed in
    [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=billreminder).
    There's also a new web site theme to go along with the changes,
    courtesy of my good friend [ElyÃ©zer Mendes
    Rezend](http://elyezer.com/)e.
-   With the move to GNOME SVN I was (obviously) granted commit
    access... and due to some schedule changes for the two current
    committers for the Brazilian translation team, I have now been
    performing translations reviews and commits. It is great to finally
    be able to do this as I already have been doing this type of work
    for the XFCE team.
-   Speaking of the XFCE team, I have been on top of the Brazilian
    Portuguese translations and the next release (coming soon I'm told)
    will be [100%
    translated](http://i18n.xfce.org/stats/index.php?mode=4&lang=trunk/pt_BR)!
-   I started attending one single class at the [University of North
    Carolina](http://unc.edu) (here in Chapel Hill) and this Tuesday was
    my first day. The class, "Database Design", is listed as a graduate
    level class but so far it's been fairly easy to follow. As I already
    have a bacchelors in BioChemistry, I'm looking forward to taking
    some bioinformatics classes in the near future.
-   I've done some travelling these last 2 weeks. Two weekends ago we
    went to the [North Carolina
    Aquarium](http://www.ncaquariums.com/ff/ffindex.htm) at Fort Fisher.
    It was the first time I went to the Carolina beaches since I moved
    here and it was a great experience! We took lots of pictures and
    spent 2 great days soaking up in the sun!

-   Last weekend we went do Ocean City in Delaware to celebrate my
    youngest's sister wedding. My whole family got together and rented a
    nice house in a fancy complex with lots of activities. There was a
    lot of swimming and drinking beer with my dad and older sister.
    Every night we would go to where my younger sister was holding the
    reception, a nice house by the lake with its own private pier! There
    was a lot of drinking, eating, and the occasional fishing off the
    pier! The evenings were amazing with a full moon and even some
    fireworks (we don't know who was doing it, but it looked really
    great from where we were). Needsless to say my kids loved it all!
    Unfortunately we forgot our camera there and now I have to wait for
    my sister to mail it back.

Well, I actually have more stuff but that will have to wait for an
upcoming post.
