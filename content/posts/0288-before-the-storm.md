Before I go into a major rant attack against Macromedia (or whatever
they're called these days) for not doing a better job at providing open
source-friendly versions of their software, I'd like to ask my fellow
Linux users the following:

Is there a way of running ShockWaveÃ‚Â  under Linux without the aid of
emulators???

I wish people would be more considerate (or do a better job at
researching alternatives out there) and use open standards when
providing their services to users via the web!
