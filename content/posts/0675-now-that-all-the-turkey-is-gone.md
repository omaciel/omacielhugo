title: Now that all the turkey is gone\...
---

This last week has been but a blur to me due to the holidays
(Thanksgiving here in the US) and my house being full of relatives who
came to visit from upstate New York. With the exception of a
[patch](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=499228) I sent (and
committed by Jonh, thanks!) to bugzilla, my time was spent doing the
following:

-   Following and answering the questions that were asked for those
    running for the **GNOME Board of Directors** (I'm one of them). As
    someone pointed out, I believe I'm the only United States citizen
    running. If you care about the GNOME Project and its future
    direction, I highly recommend that you read these threads:
    [1](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-November/msg00182.html),[2](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-November/msg00180.html),[3](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2007-November/msg00153.html).
-   Found some time to play with my **N800** again!
    [Vagalume](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2007/vagalume/)
    rules and I can't wait to get my hands on the new version for
    [Canola](http://maemo.org/downloads/product/OS2007/canola)!
-   Cleaning up my closet. I will have at least a good 50 computer books
    I'll be donating by the end of the week, all less than 1 year old
    and in excellent conditions.
-   Enjoying the weather (until 3 days ago, when the temperature dropped
    noticeably) in North Carolina. I can never get enough of the [North
    Carolina Botanical Garden](http://www.ncbg.unc.edu/) here in Chapel
    Hill.

-   ... and off course eating! :)

Anyhow, hope everyone hadÃ‚Â  a good break!
