title: BillReminder featured on Life Hacker
---

Boy was I surprised when someone told me that
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org) was a [Featured
Linux
Download](http://lifehacker.com/364033/keep-better-tabs-on-bills-with-billreminder)
on **LifeHacker**! Wow!!! There were also articles on [New Linux
User](http://www.newlinuxuser.com/remember-to-pay-your-bills-with-billreminder/)
and [Productive
Linux](http://productivelinux.com/2008/03/05/stay-on-top-of-bills-with-billreminder/).
Thank you all for taking the time to test it and recommend it too!

Some people have asked me if it is necessary to keep BillReminder
running in order to get notifications, and the answer is: no.
BillReminder has a daemon that runs in the background and will only poke
you (with the baseball bat) if there's something late or close to being
late.
