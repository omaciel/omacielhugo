In order to celebrate the holidays and the success of the Brazilian
Ubuntu community, I have decided to sponsor the **Ubuntu Sweepstakes
2005**!!!

**Rules:**

-   First of all, register yourself at the
    [Launchpad](http://www.launchpad.net) site and sign the code of
    conduct.
-   Then, send me an email with the subject "Ubuntu Sweepstake 2005"
    with your complete name and your actual Karma points. For those who
    already have an account at [Launchpad](http://www.launchpad.net),
    send me your actual Karma points.
-   Just to clarify: Submit your actual Karma points at the date you
    submit your email! All entries will be checked religiously! ;)
-   Start translating the programs listed to be released together with
    Ubuntu Dapper Drake! Or, start submiting bug reports!!! The complete
    list can be seen
    [here](https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/dapper/)!
-   Anyone may participate, independently of which distro you use or
    what team you cheer for! But do it quick!!! The sooner the better!
-   All participants and their respective Karma points will be published
    here for tracking purposes!
-   The sweepstake closes at December 25th at 12 noon (UTC)!
-   The winner will be whoever accumulates more Karma points (minimum of
    3,000) from the day of submission!

**Prize:** The winner will receive completely free of charge a copy of
"**Beginning Ubuntu Linux: From Novice to Professional**", to be
published very soon by A-Press!
