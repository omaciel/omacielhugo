title: Another post about a generic Gtk.TreeView
---

I figured, why not whip up a quick sample code to show off the
genericlist I just published? So I chose the
[Tasks](http://pimlico-project.org/tasks.html) application, written in
C/C++, as my target. A few minutes later, my "port" was born:

The application to the left is the one I whipped up... the one to the
right is the real deal! Obviously I didn't bother writing up the code to
actually store information, and this exercise was meant to be like the
penguins in the movie "**The Wild**\"... to look cute and cuddly. :)
