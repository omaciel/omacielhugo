title: Weekend Update
---

After enjoying several days of free wi-fi hotspots pretty much **every
where I went**, my mom's neighbor finally turned the WEP on and I spent
a un-wired Friday afternoon. Took the time to do some reading and
watched some tv. Went home Saturday morning and found out my main
computer's power supply had gone kaput... Luckly there is a computer
supply store literally around the block and \$40 later I was back on
business. Ended up picking up a new Western Digital 200GB hard drive and
replacing the one I had (It had started giving me I/O error messages and
made installing Ubuntu virtually impossible for me). I promptly
installed Ubuntu Hoary and am now happily using all of the features this
AMD64 has to offer!

On a different subject, I managed to get my hands on the soundtrack for
the movie "[Garden State](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333766/)." What
can I say? It is AMAZING! I was extremelly pleased with the movie and
amazed at Zach Braff's performance. He not only performed but also wrote
and directed the movie! Apparently he is also responsible for the
soundtrack.

Also got Narada's [Gypsy
Soul](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000006FCQ/102-3281810-6121732?v=glance)
CD. Great flamenco tunes for a night of friends and drinks!
