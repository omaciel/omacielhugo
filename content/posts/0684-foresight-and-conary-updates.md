-   First off, for those participating of the [Google Highly Open
    Participation
    Contest](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8), get your
    [GNOME Developer Kit now](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit)!
    [Download](http://gnome.rpath.org/) the VMWare image or the DVD and
    start hacking **today**! There will be continuous builds (the plan
    is to have them daily) so that you'll always have the freshest GNOME
    code to play with. For the translators out there, I've recommended
    the inclusion of poEdit, intltool, translate-toolkit and gettext,
    all latest versions available. Feel free to let us
    [know](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gnome-live)
    of any other application that could make your life easier.
-   To keep your [GNOME Developer
    Kit](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit) up to date, take
    advantage of the awesome [PackageKit](http://www.packagekit.org/) or
    for those interested in the amazing
    [Conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary) packaging and management
    system, run **\*sudo conary updateall**\*
-   Speaking of Conary, those who have ventured into the packaging world
    will be happy with the release of conary
    [1.2.10](http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/conarynews/2007/12/12/conary_1_2_10_released)
    and the new **cvc explain** command.

-   Have you tested the new [Foresight
    Linux](http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5928)
    (alpha 2) yet? My installation took 4 minutes, including formating a
    200GB HD. Been running it for a couple of weeks now and it's pretty
    stable. Check out PackageKit updating it this evening.
