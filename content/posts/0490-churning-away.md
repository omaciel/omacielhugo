Ok, so we now have [Live
CDs](http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5402)
(not VMware images... towards the end of the page) with GNOME 2.17.92
fresh out of the oven! Come and get it!!! :)

The user name is **Live** and the password is blanked, so change it once
you get a chance.
