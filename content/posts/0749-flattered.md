This last Thursday I was surprised by **Johan Dahlin** when he showed me
the new feature he's adding to
[Stoq](http://www.stoq.com.br/index.php?lang=en): colored coded
categories.

He said he was inspired by the same feature I added to
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org). Wow! I couldn't
help but feel very flattered with this... after all, **Stoq** is a great
piece of software developed by a very clever crew!
