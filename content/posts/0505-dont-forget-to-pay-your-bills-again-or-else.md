It's been a while since I last wrote about my pet project,
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.sourceforge.net/), a late and due
bills notifier for the desktop. With the birth of my daughter **Kate**,
and the projects I'm involved with at **rPath**, together with the
translation of **GNOME 2.18**, there wasn't much time left to do
anything else. Fortunately, I had the great pleasure of adding one more
developer to the project: **Luiz Armesto**.

After exchanging a few ideas on IRC about the direction I wanted to take
the project, Luiz simply carrried on his shoulders the entire re-write
process for our database layer, to support a flexible and dinamic
architecture. And it didn't really take too long for the results to
show! As if that wasn't enough, he took upon himself to write a new
notification mechanism, detached from the main application (shown
below).

The code is now better divided (using MVC) to facilitate the assignment
of new tasks and modules among the developers. Speaking of developers
and contributors, I want to take the opportunity to thank the following
people (in no particular order) for their involvement in the project:

-   Laudeci Oliveira
-   Luiz Armesto
-   Giovanni Deganni
-   Ruivaldo
-   Mario Danic
-   Led Style
-   Vinicius Depizzol

If anyone is interested in giving us a hand, be that documenting,
translating, re-designing the web site, etc, etc, just send me an email
or ping me on \#billreminder at Freenode.
