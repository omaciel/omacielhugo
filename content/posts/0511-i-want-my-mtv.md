Having just seen [Lucas
Rocha](http://blogs.gnome.org/view/lucasr/2007/03/22/0)\'s screencast
where he creates a simple python plugin for the [Hildon
Desktop](https://stage.maemo.org/svn/maemo/projects/haf/trunk/hildon-desktop/),
I just cannot wait to get my hands on a N800. But it is kind of pricey
for my very limited budget right now (or for the next several months for
that matter. I wonder what a translator could do to get one of those
nice discounts I read about in the web? ;)
