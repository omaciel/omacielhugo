Following up on a previous post, my good friend [Steve
Goguen](http://opensource.meetup.com/53/members/468901/) has officially
registered [The Northern NJ Open Source
Alliance](http://opensource.meetup.com/53/). It will be an attempt to
bring all the other "geeky" MeetUp groups from Northern New Jersey
together into a an unified one. We should hear back soon from some of
the other MeetUp organizers and work something out. I think the goal is
to schedule all our individual meetings to coincide on the same dates.
I'm looking forward to our tentative first meeting this Monday, March
21st at the Panera Bread in Paramus. Any fellow geek enthusiast roaming
around my page is welcome to join in.
