title: "GNOME Desktop 2.18: Almost 100% localized to Brazilian
  Portuguese"

Been working hard with the GNOME Brazilian team to finish up the
translation effort in time for 2.18. With the release date just around
the corner, it is almost time to reap what we have sown:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Language Team         Documentation (%         User Interface (%
                        translated)              translated)
  --------------------- ------------------------ -------------------------
  Arabic                0% (130/8/23855)         99% (36988/0/3)

  British English       32% (7912/0/16081)       99% (36988/0/3)

  French                74% (17962/128/5903)     99% (36988/0/3)

  Portuguese            0% (0/0/23993)           99% (36988/0/3)

  Swedish               67% (16198/146/7649)     99% (36988/0/3)

  **Brazilian           19% (4794/811/18388)     **99% (36928/20/43)**
  Portuguese**                                   

  Catalan               0% (144/1/23848)         99% (36837/90/64)

  Korean                0% (54/18/23921)         99% (36785/2/204)

  Vietnamese            0% (195/6/23792)         99% (36707/111/173)

  German                3% (819/76/23098)        99% (36704/120/167)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, the joined effort put together by the
[GNOME](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeBR/Traducao) and
[Ubuntu](http://wiki.ubuntu-br.org/TimeDeTraducao) Brazilian
localization team has paid off, and though the documentation is not in
the same level as the user interface, it is something we will be dealing
with in the very next iteration. With 99% (36928/20/43) done, where 20
strings are marked as doubtfull and 43 without a translation, we should
be 100% in no time!
