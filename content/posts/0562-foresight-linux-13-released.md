title: Foresight Linux 1.3 released!
---

Congratulations to the entire [Foresight
Linux](http://www.foresightlinux.org) team for releasing their version
1.3, timed to be released with **GNOME 2.18.2**!!!

Some of the new features are:

![image0](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/gnome.png)**GNOME**:
This is the third Foresight Linux release with GNOME 2.18 (after 2.18.0
& 2.18.1), and contains minor fixes and improvements.

![image1](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/system-search.png)**Desktop
Search**: With **Beagle** 0.2.17 and tweaked for Foresight Linux, we
continue to improve the ability to search your computer.

![image2](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/epiphany.png)**Web
browsing**: We have upgraded **Epiphany** web browser to version 2.18.2.

![image3](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/firstboot.png)**First
Boot Process**: The outdated **Firstboot** mechanism has been replaced
by our modified version of autoconfig from Knoppix to configure X.Org,
and creating the first user is done by **Firstrun**. This will make it
even easier for users to install Foresight.

![image4](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/pidgin.png)**Chat**:
... with **Pidgin** (formerly known as GAIM) updated to version 2.0.1.
Pidgin supports multiple chat protocols such as Jabber, MSN, AIM, ICQ,
IRC and more.

![image5](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/hal.png)**HAL**:
was updated to 0.5.9. HAL, the Hardware Abstraction Layer, has updates
for a number of devices. This should make Foresight compatible with more
peripherals.

![image6](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/xorg.png)**X.Org
7.2**: The new graphical server makes it easier for users by
automatically installing monitors and video cards without editing
configuration files.

![image7](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/compiz.png)
The latest **Compiz** 3D window manager, installed by default on
Foresight Linux

![image8](http://www.foresightlinux.org/sitemedia/images/emblems/48x48/conary.png)**Package
Manager**: The **Conary** package manager has been updated to the latest
version, 1.2.27. Conary is a full featured distributed package manager
similar to RPM or dpkg, featuring the ability to install software,
manage dependencies and even rollback to previously installed versions.

# Important Bugfixes:

-   More Digital Cameras are now supported to import ([issue
    \#143](http://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL-143), [issue
    \#247](http://issues.foresightlinux.org/browse/FL-247) )
-   Gtk is now localized. This means that dialogs like printing and file
    opening are now available in your local language.
