title: SmÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord News for September 2009
---

It's been a while since I last wrote anything on my blog so here are
some interesting nuggets:

-   I've been **house hunting** for the last 3-4 months and I can
    honestly say that it is a very intense experience! There are so many
    things to learn and remember and so many different things to
    consider! Wouldn't be nice if you knew right up front all the costs
    and fees involved in purchasing a house, the same way you know how
    much it costs to purchase a pair of sneakers (cost of sneakers plus
    sales tax)? Alas, the hard work has paid off and in about 3 weeks
    I'll be a home owner for the first time!
-   Work has kept me very busy these last few months but thanks to some
    new goals and new hires, the future is looking pretty bright for
    **rPath** and I'm very excited to be a part of it all! I managed to
    hack on a proof of concept for a **Django**-based tool for our
    **QA** department which received a good deal of good feedback! I've
    also spent some time cleaning up our wiki and getting things ready
    for the new QA engineer who's starting in a few weeks.
-   [Foresight Linux](http://www.foresightlinux.org), my distribution of
    choice for the last 3 years, has undergone a lot of updates and
    changes these last few weeks, including a new sub-project called
    "[Boots](http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/boots/Home)", a
    **Fedora** remix. Basically, "Boots is proposed to be as faithful as
    possible an import of the upstream binary platform packages, within
    the constraints of being repackaged for **Conary** using **Conary**
    best practices." Also, as **Foresight** follows a rolling release
    model, I'm enjoying having latest **Firefox, Chromium, kernel
    2.6.30.x, Xorg 7.4, OpenOffice 3.1.1** only an update away. **GNOME
    2.28** is already in our development label and should be hitting the
    stable branch soon!
-   Speaking about **GNOME**, the Brazilian translation team went
    through a (**much needed**) last minute change in the coordination
    and the entire team rallied to deliver, once again, a completely
    translated desktop! Though the new coordinator lacks experience
    using git and managing a translation team, he makes up with a good
    attitude and humility.
-   Still talking about translations, I've been keeping the [Transifex
    Appliance](https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://rbatest02.eng.rpath.com/api/products/transifex)
    up to date on both development and stable fronts. Thanks to the
    power of having a system version controlled management modelÂ under
    my finger prints, maintaining and delivering the appliance in
    synchrony with the development and release schedule of the the
    [Transifex](http://transifex.org/) project is child's play!
-   I spent some time playing with
    [Mallard](http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard) and using it to
    implement a new [User
    Guide](http://github.com/omaciel/foresight-user-guide) for
    **Foresight Linux**! In the next few weeks I will also port
    [Cheese](http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/) to mallard so that they
    can also enjoy of this great documentation tool! Speaking of Cheese,
    I had the pleasure of lending a helping hand proofreading the [tour
    page](http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/tour) and was honored that
    **Daniel Siegel** asked my permission to use my **daughter's
    pictures** to show off the new 2.28 features! Thanks dude! :)
-   When not going nuts over the many different inspections needed for
    purchasing a house, reviewing and committing translations,
    maintaining packages and software appliances or spending quality
    time with my family, I try to keep up with my new year's resolution
    from last year of reading a book every day during my lunch break.
    I've read quite a few books this year, some times juggling more than
    one book at a time. Lately I've been finishing up "**The Last of the
    Mohicans**\" and am gearing up to start reading Â \"[Emblem
    Divide](http://emblemdivide.wordpress.com/)", a novel by my good
    friend **Pete Savage**. My curiosity got the best of me and I just
    had to read the first page! :) The best part of the book in my
    opinion is not as much as all the "easter eggs" he sprinkled here
    and there, but the reason why he wrote it! Want to know about it?
    Check out the web site for the book! :)

I guess this is about it for now. If I haven't replied to your email,
please accept my apologies. I have a pretty lengthy cue of emails to
reply and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to
ping me on **IRC** (nick is **OgMaciel** in pretty much all servers,
including **Freenode** and **GimpNet**) as your chances of getting a
reply will be much higher. :)
