title: Flickr Tool for Linux

Browsing [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com) the other day for pictures
tagged with the word "Linux", I came across the screenshot of a tool for
uploading pictures to your Flickr account from your desktop.

Now, I know F-Spot can do that too but this one seemed to be so simple!
I haven't had a chance to test it yet, so... head on down to the
developer's [web site](http://micampe.it/things/flickruploadr) and check
out how to download and install it!
