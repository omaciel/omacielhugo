Conference](http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/events/12BOS06A) held
in Boston, MA will take place this April 3 - 6, 2006.Ã‚Â  I have
volunteered to organize the [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org) booth
and am looking for Linux and/or Open Source enthusiasts from the area
(NJ/NY/MA) to help me "man" the booth.Ã‚Â  If you're genuinely
interested and can afford to pay for your own expenses, please contact
