title: The real terrorists always get away
---

Today, 60 years ago:

-   [Bocks Car](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocks_Car)
-   [Fat Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man)
-   21 kilotons of Plutonium
-   [Nagasaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki%2C_Nagasaki)
-   **40000+** civilians pulverized to death!

The terrorists got away, and today we can see the airplane "proudly"
displayed in an american museum.

September 11th, 2001:

-   [2,976](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11%2C_2001%2C_attacks)+
    people have died!
-   Afganistan and Irak invaded!
-   More than 3000 soldiers have died after the "end of the war"!
-   More civilians die every day!

The terrorists once again got away!

I used to think you could not judge a nation based on the decision of
its government. But a nation that openly supports this type of behavior
has no excuse!

**Update**: Locked comments.Ã‚Â  This is one of those topics that will
never have an end, unfortunately.Ã‚Â  But I can tell that it served well
its purpose of waking people up and remember what happened that tragic
day.
