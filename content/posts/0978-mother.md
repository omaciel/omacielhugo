Thank you Mom:

-   For being my very first **true love**!
-   For being strong enough, though only 24, when the doctors handed you
    on your birthday a tiny little boy with withÂ **Arthrogryposis
    Multiplex Congenita**, a rareÂ [congenital
    disorder](/wiki/Congenital_disorder) that is characterized by
    multipleÂ [joint](/wiki/Joint) [contractures](/wiki/Contracture)and
    can includeÂ [muscle weakness](/wiki/Muscle_weakness)
    andÂ [fibrosis](/wiki/Fibrosis)
    (WikipediaÂ [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis)).
-   For **seeing hope** where others saw despair!
-   For **going against everyone and everything** that told you to
    conform and give up on me!
-   For the **many hours** you spent travelling by bus with me on your
    lap so you could bring me to a specialist!
-   For **choosing not to believe** when they also told you there was no
    cure for me!
-   For the many times you've **gone hungry** so I could eat!
-   For being strong enough and **hold back your tears** when you heard
    me cry as you forced me to do physical therapy!
-   For teaching me to **never feel sorry** for myself!
-   For teaching me to **never give up**!
-   For teaching me to **be strong**!
-   For teaching me **to dream**!
-   For teaching me to **laugh** but also to **cry**!
-   For **being there** for me when things got tough!
-   For teaching me how to **dance and swim**!
-   For the **many hours** you spent making sure I did my **homework**
    and understood the subjects!
-   For helping me **mend a broken heart** during the teenage years!
-   For teaching me to **respect all forms of life**!
-   For teaching me to be **open minded**!
-   For teaching me to **count my blessings**!
-   For never letting me sit on my butt and acceptÂ **mediocrity**!
-   For being such a great **mother-in-law** to my **wife**!
-   For being an amazing **grandmother** to my **kids**!
-   For being such an **inspirational** person and a **role model** for
    our family!
-   For **shaping my entire life** and for bringing these tears of joy I
    have right now just to thing **how blessed** I am for having you as
    **my mom**!
