Been spending some quality hacking time these last few days, basically
re-writting my tentative Rss reader application. The first 2 iterations
relied on the [Rss.NET](http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/) code library
but after hitting some major obstacles I sort of "left it by the side of
the road" while I re-grouped my ideas. Last week I finally gathered
enough ideas to go back to "production." I decided to hack away at the
[Rss.NET](http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/) library and turn it into a
smaller, lean, and meaner piece of code. With that said, I have spent
every precious little free time I get working on the new version. At
first I thought I'd call it RssReader.NET but am now toying with the new
name of WickedReader... Suggestions are welcome!
