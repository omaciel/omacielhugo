title: Can you hear the crickets?
---

Well, so far nobody who read this blog (contrary to the
[portuguese](http://blog.ogmaciel.com) version) has signed up for the
Ubuntu Sweepstakes 2005! My other [blog](http://blog.ogmaciel.com) seems
to be fairing much better though and 3 people have officially signed up!
Maybe I've been spending way too much time handling the Ubuntu
translation and such, and not getting enough exposure among the
english-speaking folks?

On an unrelated note, I just learned a [new
way](http://primates.ximian.com/~federico/news-2005-12.html#07) for
feeling relaxed all day long! ;)
