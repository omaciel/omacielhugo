title: Rotating the screen for a TabletPC
---

This was a very busy Sunday, with a lot of soccer on tv (or how we call
it outside the U.S., football), a lot of beer, and B-B-Q, like a good
brazilian should.Ã‚Â  ;)Ã‚Â  In between a lot of meat, beer, checking
translations, participating on a podcast, and an unexpected visit from
my in-laws, I somehow managed to "play" with my TabletPC and rotate the
screen.Ã‚Â  The tip came via a comment on my previous post, and involves
the addition of a simple line in the xorg.conf <file:Option>
Ã¢â‚¬Å"RandRRotationÃ¢â‚¬Â?

All you have to do is re-start X (pressing CTRL + ALT + BACKSPACE worked
for me) and, opening a terminal, typing the following command:

> xrandr -o { left \| right \| inverted \| normal }

As you can see in the screenshot abaixo, my TabletPC's screen was
rotated 90 degrees:

The only issue I had was with the mouse (or even the stylus pen) not
re-associating its axis, what made it very difficult to take this
screebshot.Ã‚Â

Ã‚Â  I don't know if there's a graphical interface for xrandr, but I am
already salivating at the possibilities for writing my own.
