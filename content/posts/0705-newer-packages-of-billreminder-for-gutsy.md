title: Newer packages of BillReminder for Gutsy
---

Some people reported dependency errors when using one of the two .deb
packages I announced today. Turns out it was due to **python-sqlite2**
and **python-image**... Our own [Luiz
Armesto](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LuizArmesto) has whipped up a newer
package that can be downloaded
[here](http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/billreminder_0.3.0-svn446-1_all.deb),
now with all the right dependencies. Thanks to **Diogo Autilio** and
**Alex Bevilacqua** again for sending me his packages as well (see
comments)!

**UPDATE**: Just as I was about to submit this post, **Diogo** sent me a
[newer](http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/billreminder_0.3-svn453_i386.deb)
package with updates up to this second! Wow!
