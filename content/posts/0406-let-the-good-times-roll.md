Just a quick note since I still have no internet at home and have been
busy trying to catch up at my new job:

-   North Carolina rocks!!!
-   Gorgeous weather!
-   **NO TRAFFIC JAMS**!
-   Eastern Carolina BBQ is awsome!
-   Python all day long is what the doctor recommended!
-   The rPath crew know how to make one feel at home! ;)
-   [Jamocha](http://www.goodberrys.com/html/goodberry_s_flavor_of_the_day.html)!!!
-   Fresh ground coffee!!!
-   Got
    [sponsored](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperSummitMountainView/Attendees)
    to go to the [Ubuntu Developer
    Summit](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperSummitMountainView)
    in Mountain View, CA!!!

Hopefully, I'll have some pictures loaded (and internet acess) by next
week.

**Note**: When was the last time you saw me use so many exclamation
marks before? ;)
