Here's what happened this week:

1.  [Radio Tray 0.5.1](http://../?p=880)
    -   \"It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Radio
        Tray 0.5.1! I have been following the development of this tiny
        streaming media player from the very start and even cloned it so
        that I could play with it on BitBucket.\"
2.  [Stop whining and improve your life](http://../?p=884)
    -   \"During your day to day conversation with your friends and
        family members, do you find yourself talking about work or life
        in general in a negative manner?\"
3.  [Learning Inkscape?](http://../?p=890)
    -   \"Lately I have found myself spending more and more time playing
        with Inkscape, the amazing open source vector graphic editor!
        The main reason being that my oldest daughter has shown interest
        in drawing and graphic design.\"
4.  [Command Line Tools with Python OptParse](http://../?p=900)
    -   \"It is not very uncommon for me to receive some code requests
        from friends looking for a little help to â€œmake something
        easierâ€?. Iâ€™m talking about those pesky day to day things
        that after a while makes you go: â€œIf I could only push a
        button and have it done!â€?\"
5.  [From the â€œBetter Than Sliced Breadâ€? Department:
    Terminator](http://../?p=914)
    -   \"Basically, think about opening a single terminal (console)
        window and then splitting it down the middle (vertically) to get
        now two separate and independent terminalsâ€¦ and then splitting
        the left terminal horizontally, giving you now three
        terminalsâ€¦ and thenâ€¦ well, you probably get the drift by
        now.\"
