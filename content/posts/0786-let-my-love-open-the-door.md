Dedicated to my wife...

\"Let My Love Open The Door\" Written by [Pete
Townshend](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0870228/)

When people keep repeating That you'll never fall in love When everybody
keeps retreating But you can't seem to get enough

Let my love open the door Let my love open the door Let my love open the
door To your heart

When everything feels all over When everybody seems unkind I bring you a
four leaf clover Take all the worry out of your mind

Let my love open the door Let my love open the door Let my love open the
door To your heart

I have the only key to your heart I can stop you falling apart Try
today, you'll find this way Come on and give me a chance to say Let my
love open the door It's all I'm living for Release yourself from misery
There's only one thing gonna set you free That's my love

Let my love open the door Let my love open the door Let my love open the
door

When tragedy befalls you Don't let it drag you down Love can cure your
problems You're so lucky I'm around

Let my love open the door Let my love open the door Let my love open the
door To your heart
