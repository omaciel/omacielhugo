title: VMWare and World of Warcraft
---

My first attempt to install and play World of Warcraft on a virtual
Windows XP pc (through VMWare) running atop Gentoo Linux has hit its
first obstacle. Haven't really done any research but it seems to me that
accessing the CD-ROM at the "raw" level is the culprit. More to follow.
