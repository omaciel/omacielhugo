The race is on to get Ubuntu Linux completely translated into other
languages.Ã‚Â  We, the [Brazilian Portuguese
Team](https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pt-br), are currently in
5th "place".

Inspired by the Ubuntu [Classroom](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom), I
have taken the iniciative to create 3 "classroom" sessions in portuguese
(pt_BR) to be hosted starting today at the \#ubuntu-br-tradutores
channel @ Freenode.Ã‚Â  More information can be found in my
[announcement](http://blog.ogmaciel.com/?p=174) (in portuguese),
including links to documentation on [how to use
IRC](http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/UsandoIRC). :)

The topics covered in the 3 sessions will be:

-   What are Launchpad, Malone, and Rosetta?
-   How to create a GnuPG key
-   What is the Code of Conduct?
-   How to sign the Code of Conduct
-   List of terms (glossary) used during translations
-   How to use Rosetta
-   Best practices when translating

For the portuguese-speakingÃ‚Â  (not only brazilians) readers out there,
here's the
[guideline](http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/DiaDoTradutor1Sessao) we'll be
following for today's class.

Huge kudos do the [Brazilian Documentation
Team](http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/TimeDeDocumentacao) for rising up to
my call of action!Ã‚Â  They've not only revamped the
[main](http://ubuntubrasil.org/) site, but have also generated tons (and
I literally mean **tons**!) of excelente
[documentation](http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/Documentacao)!
