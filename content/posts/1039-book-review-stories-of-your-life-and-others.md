A while back I came across a reference to a book that really caught my
attention: [The Lifecycle of Software
Objects](http://www.amazon.com/Lifecycle-Software-Objects-Ted-Chiang/dp/1596063173/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1297290928&sr=8-7)
by **Ted Chiang**. At first glimpse, based on the title, I thought that
it would be a technical book related to **object oriented programming**
and **software life cycle**, but time would put me in for a good
surprise.

Some time later someone gave me a copy of another Ted Chiang book, a
collection of short stories titled "[Stories of Your Life: and
Others](http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Ted-Chiang/dp/1931520720/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1297351710&sr=8-1)".Â ?If
I could summarize my impressions with this book in one simple word, it
would be: **Wow**! All of the short stories included were very
captivating and well written, something that, in my humble opinion, is
something very hard to pull off when compiling a list of short stories
from one single author. Ted Chiang shows over and over that he really
does his homework while researching for a story, so if you enjoy reading
a good story with a clear and solid technical background intermingled in
the plot, you're in for a special treat! His prose and style just flows
so easily that anyone can pretty much follow the logic behind the varied
themes behind each story even if you've never read about object oriented
programming or [Fermat's
Principle](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/Optics/Fermat's_Principle)
before.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in reading
something new and fresh that will give you enough food for thought for
quite a while!
