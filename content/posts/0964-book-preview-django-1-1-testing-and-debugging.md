What a great day to kick of the day! Just received my complimentary copy
of the book "[Django 1.1 Testing and
Debugging](http://bit.ly/DjangoTestingDebugBook)\" from [Packt
Publishing](http://packtpub.com)! From the book's overview page:

-   Develop Django applications quickly with fewer bugs through
    effective use of automated testing and debugging tools.
-   Ensure your code is accurate and stable throughout development and
    production by using Django's test framework.
-   Understand the working of code and its generated output with the
    help of debugging tools.
-   Packed with detailed working examples that illustrate the techniques
    and tools for debugging.

I think I know what I'm doing this weekend! :) There's a FREE
[chapter](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/7566_Django%201.1%20Testing%20and%20Debugging_SampleChapter_1.pdf)
you can download too to whet your appetite in case you're interested.
