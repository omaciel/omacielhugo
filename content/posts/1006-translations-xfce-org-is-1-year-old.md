Received the following
[email](http://foo-projects.org/pipermail/xfce-i18n/2010-August/009663.html)
this morning:

>     Last night our Transifex installation turned 1 year old. I think with
>     101 users and  4012 submissions in 45 languages it has been quite a
>     step forward compared to the previous mailing list-based submission
>     system. For that I'd like to thank all the people involved, most
>     noticeably Jannis for the initial setup, the Transifex guys for help
>     and fixing bugs, Og for the appliance we've been running for the last
>     half year and of course the Translators with all their patience and
>     effort to make it a success.

This has an extra special meaning for me, not only because I am one of
the **101** users contributing translations to the
[Xfce](http://www.xfce.org/) project, or because I'm a huge supporter of
the work the [Transifex](http://transifex.org) guys have been doing, but
because of their use of the [Transifex
Appliance](http://bit.ly/Transifex)!

You see, a while back I needed a "pet" project to use as a learning tool
to learn about creating, maintaining and deploying software appliances
with the technologies we develop here at [work](http://www.rpath.com).
Transifex was the project that caught my attention, mainly for being a
tool for translators and for using
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) under the hood.

I've been maintaining the Transifex Appliance for quite some time now,
all by my lonesome self and putting a lot of my free time. So it feels
great to hear that the appliance is being used in a production
environment and that it is used by several users!

So, congratulations to the **Xfce translators** and ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿**Nick
Schermer** for sticking with the appliance and providing tons of great
feedback on how to improve it!
