title: Thank you Raphael Higino Silva
---

It is with a heavy heart that I announce the tragic news of the death of
**Raphael Higino Silva**. For those who don't know who he is, suffice to
say that he had been a very active member of the GNOME Brazilian
translation team for some time now! It is weird for me to refer to him
in the past tense...

The news came to me via an email that was sent to the Brazilian mailing
list just a few minutes ago by a close friend of the family. Though I
have never met him in person, I considered him as a good friend and he
will be missed!

I've asked people to see if we, as a community, can send his family some
flowers and maybe a card expressing our gratitude for all that he has
done for the Brazilian community. I'll post more information as I get
them....
