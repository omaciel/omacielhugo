... and today, chatting online with [Andr√©
Noel](http://andrenoel.com.br), I remembered that I was at **Linux World
Expo** in **Boston**, MA representing Ubuntu! I had my "15 seconds of
fame" when I was [interviewed](http://www.lulu.tv/?p=733) by the guys
from [Lulu.tv](http://www.lulu.tv).

Those were 3 great days that I'll never forget...
