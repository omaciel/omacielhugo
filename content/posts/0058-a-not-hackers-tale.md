title: "A (Not) Hacker's Tale"

This is just too [funny](http://www.jellyslab.com/~bteo/hacker.htm)!!!
Not sure if it really happened or not but my professional experience has
proven me wrong many times before! Hehehe... Read on...

*Something nice I read on www.stophiphop.de (got pointed there by a
comment on www.macguardians.de) is this nice story of a hacker:

\<http://www.stophiphop.de\>\`\_\_ (got pointed there by a comment on
\`www.macguardians.de \<http://www.macguardians.de\>\`\_\_) is this nice
story of a hacker:
http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new...php?storyid=184 (site might
be down, quite a lot of people are reading this).*

In case you don't speak german (just as this hacker), I've tried a
little translation to english. I might have made some spelling errors,
but the original spelling wasn't perfect either. The guy really said
"buy buy" in the german version. I've posted this on the forum on
<http://www.desertcombat.com> before, so if this looks familiar, might
be the same. I've corrected some mistakes and put the \<\> back to the
right version (The DC forum does not support them). All censoring was
done by this particular forum here. Notice that in germany we get DST
earlier than in the US.

The story starts (I'm shortcutting here) with an \[Please control your
cussing\] insulting everyone on the IRC channel. Most people there
believed it was rather funny, but it got even more funny. For
information: The dangerous hacker is called bitchchecker and the one
being hacked and original author of the comments, who is talking here,
is known as Elch. 127.0.0.1 is always the IP-adress of the computer
you're currently using, any request there will return to your computer.

What happened is clear: That guy entered his own IP-Adress in his mighty
Hack-Tool and crashed his own PC. This way, the attack on my PC was a
failure. I was already starting to think that I did not have to worry,
but a good hacker never calls it a day. Two minutes later he returned.

There was a tension in the room... Would he manage, after these two
failures, to crash my PC? I waited. Nothing happened. I felt relieve...
Six minutes passed by until he prepared the next wave of attack. Being a
Hacker, who usually cracks whole data centers, he knew what his problem
was now.

He calls me girly and says only his grandma would use a firewall. I know
that elder people are much more intelligent then younger, but I couldn't
let that rest. To see whether he really is a good hacker I lie and let
everything as it is. I don't have a firewall at all, only my router.

In panic I started the Windows Explorer, my heart beating faster. Had I
under-estimated him?

Yes, true, G: and F: were gone. Did I ever have them? Doesn't matter, I
did not have time to think, I was scared. bitchchecker was comforting me
with a music tip.

Drive E:? Oh my god... All the games are there! And the vacation
pictures! I instantly take a look. Everything still there. But the
hacker said it was deleted....

Or isn't it happening on my computer?

The guy is good: My CD-drive is allegedly deleted! Bitchchecker turned
my ancient disk sucker into a burner! But how did he do this? I'll have
to ask him. Some encourage him. He himself is giving advice how to avoid
the disaster on my hard drives.

Should I tell him he's not attacking my computer?

Too late... It's 20:22 when we get the last message of our hacker with
the alias "bitchchecker". We see that he has a "Ping timeout". We
haven't seen him since then... must be the Daylight Saving Time.
