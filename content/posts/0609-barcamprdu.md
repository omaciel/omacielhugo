So here I am at [BarCampRDU](http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU), together
with the [rPath](http://www.rpath.org) crew. Got to meet a few new faces
and am now sitting through my first session about distributed version
control with Bzr and Launchpad. So far it sounds very much like
Mercurial, which is pretty cool!

Anyhow, hope to be able to blog some more later today.
