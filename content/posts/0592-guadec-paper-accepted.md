title: GUADEC Paper Accepted
---

Last week I was pleasantly surprised to see the following message in my
inbox:

> Hi, (apologies for the delay in sending this acceptance mail) Your
> lightning talk has been accepted for the Lightning Talk session at
> GUADEC 2006, in Birmingham UK. Ã‚Â If you have not already registered
> for GUADEC, you should register now at
> <http://guadec.org/registration>. We look forward to seeing you at
> GUADEC! Ross Burton GUADEC Papers Committee

A couple of friends had motivated me to submit my
[talk](http://guadec.org/node/601) and I was so looking forward to
finally meet them face to face.Ã‚Â  But alas, the announcement came a
few weeks too late as I have already made a commitment at work during
this period, as well as scheduled my vacation.Ã‚Â  To top it off, I
haven't received my American passport yet and without it I cannot leave
the country!

I would like to thank the GUADEC Papers Committe for the opportunity and
hope to be able to attend it next year!
