title: For The Win!
---

Sunday I was lucky enough to have the chance of attending a book reading
(well, a passage actually) by [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/)!
The event took place at [Flyleaf Books](http://www.flyleafbooks.com/)
right here in **Chapel Hill**, a charming independent book store that
will most definitely see me and my kids more often from now on (plus,
they're right next to **Foster's Market** and **Flying Burrito**)!

Cory came across as a very humble, down to earth kind of guy and it
didn't take long for the crowed to feel right at home. He took the time
to answer random questions while we waited for some of the late
arrivals, and once the clock struck 13:00 he proceeded to read a passage
from his new book, "For The Win".

Ever since I listened to "[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)\"
read by **Douglas Adam** himself, I learn to appreciate listening to
books when they're read by their respective authors. I mean, who best to
convey what the characters really meant, the rightÂ intonationÂ of
voice, then the author of a book, right?

So, you could say that I had pretty high expectations about this
event... and I was not disappointed! The reading was absolutely awesome
and Cory is a great story teller, grabbing everyone's attention, the
entire room getting completely absorbed by the narrative, holding their
breath... and then he left us hanging there at a major event of a scene,
as if urging us to grab a copy of the book (you can download it free of
charge too) to see what happens next!

After a round of applause, he started answering questions from the
audience, starting with the younger kids that were present. A couple of
things that came out of the Q&A session:

-   Cory uses **Ubuntu** on his **Thinkpad**;
-   When he writes on Linux, all of his writings are done using gEdit,
    which he pronounced "Get it"; :)
-   He saves his writings in \*.txt format, so that he's not tied to a
    specific text editor;
-   He uses a python script called
    "[flashbake](http://github.com/commandline/flashbake)\" to
    synchronize his writings and some metadata related to his
    environment (i.e. current music he's listening to, the weather where
    he is, etc) to a git repository;
-   In response to why he makes his books freely available for download,
    he gave us 3 reasons. One of them: better have his work out there
    and known to others, than be an obscure author and never see your
    work out there!

Before we left, I got in line to get my "For The Win" book signed and
take a picture with Cory. As he was signing the book my oldest daughter
turns to him and proudly says: "I want to be a writer when I grow up."
To which he replied, "Write a little bit every day. Make sure to end in
the middle of a sentence. Pick it up the next day and continue it." I
can tell that she took it to heart!
