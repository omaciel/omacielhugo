title: Awkward Places To Run Into Your Job Interviewer
---

Another gem from [Piled Higher and Deeper](http://www.phdcomics.com)
comic! It reminded me of my last job interview... Right before I was
interviewed by "the boss" I asked to use the restroom. "Sure," he said.
"I also need to go." So there we were standing side by side making small
talk... Now THAT was awkward!
