title: Xml Performance Checklist
---

Straight from Microsoft's [Improving .NET Application Performance and
Scalability: Improving XML
Performance](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/scalenetchapt09.asp):

# Design Considerations

Check

Description

\*

Choose the appropriate XML class for the job.

\*

Consider validating large documents.

\*

Process large documents in chunks, if possible.

\*

Use streaming interfaces.

\*

Consider hard-coded transformations.

\*

Consider element and attribute name lengths.

\*

Consider sharing the **XmlNameTable**.

# Parsing XML

Check

Description

\*

Use **XmlTextReader** to parse large XML documents.

\*

Use **XmlValidatingReader** for validation.

\*

Consider combining **XmlReader** and **XmlDocument**.

\*

On the **XmlReader**, use the **MoveToContent** and **Skip** methods to
skip unwanted items.

# Validating XML

Check

Description

\*

Use **XmlValidatingReader**.

\*

Do not validate the same document more than once.

\*

Consider caching the schema.

# Writing XML

Check

Description

\*

Use **XmlTextWriter**.

# XPath Queries

Check

Description

\*

Use **XPathDocument** to process XPath statements.

\*

Avoid the // operator by reducing the search scope.

\*

Compile both dynamic and static XPath expressions.

# XSLT Processing

Check

Description

\*

Use **XPathDocument** for faster XSLT transformations.

\*

Consider caching compiled style sheets.

\*

Consider splitting complex transformations into several stages.

\*

Minimize the size of the output document.

\*

Write efficient XSLT.

Atsushi Eno from the [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com/) took
his time to write what he thinks [the "true" Checklists: XML
Performance](http://monkey.workarea.jp/lb/archive/2005/8-08.html) should
be. I can see how some of his (different as compared to Microsoft's
recommendation) points could be valid based on his personal experience
but he confused me with his very first statement:

> Avoid XML as long as possible.

Will have to email him and clarify...

**UPDATE**: I did email Atsushi Eno and he graceously took the time to
answer some of my questions! Neat!
