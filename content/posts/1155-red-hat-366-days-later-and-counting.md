Woke up to the following email this morning:

Time sure flies when you're having too much fun! I can't believe it's
been one whole year since I joined [Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/) as
a **Senior QA Engineer** to work on their
[CloudForms](http://www.redhat.com/products/cloud-computing/cloudforms/)
project! So much has happened since then that it is a bit hard to
remember all the new and exciting things I had the pleasure of being a
part of! It is absolutely grate to be able to work on such a cool and
challenging environment, and to experience first hand what open source
and meritocracy really means!

I remember being asked during my interview process what my long-term
goals were (or something along these lines), and my answer was:

> \"In the next 5 years I want to be the **Go To** person to all
> questions related to **CloudForms**!"

Well, one year down and four more to go! :)
