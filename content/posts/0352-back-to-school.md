Feeling a bit rusty with your linux skills? Are you a new Ubuntu linux
user and feel overwelmed with packaging managers, gpg keys, and IRC
lingo? Well, the solution is right around the corner. The folks at [New
User Network](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewUserNetwork) have launched the
[Ubuntu Classroom](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom), a project aimed
at delivering good, live didatic material to all users, new and
"seasoned."

Some classes have already been scheduled for the month of August and
there are some open slots for instructors. Though I can assume all
classes will be administered in english, I'm sure they wouldn't oppose
the idea of having some slots for classes in other languages. So, if you
feel like helping out and need more information (and to view an up to
date schedule), check out their page.
