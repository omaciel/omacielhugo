Tomorrow will be a very important to me! At exactly 14:00 UTC I'll be
presented to the [Ubuntu Community
Council](https://launchpad.net/people/communitycouncil) for approval to
become part of the [Ubuntu
Member](https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntumembers) Team! I have spent
quite some time helping out the Brazilian Ubuntu community these last 2
months and I think I'm ready for the next level of involvement!

The meeting will take place via IRC and I can barely wait to see what
comes out of this!
