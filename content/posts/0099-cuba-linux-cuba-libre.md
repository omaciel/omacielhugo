I completely missed this
[little](http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20050517/tc_afp/cubacomputersitlinux)
nugget:

> *\"Cuba will gradually switch to the open-source Linux operating
> system for its state computers, eliminating its exclusive use of
> Microsoft Windows, the government daily Juventud Rebelde reported\"*

If they succeed with this migration Cuba will become (I believe) the
first nation to completely go Open Source! Maybe Brazil will be next???
