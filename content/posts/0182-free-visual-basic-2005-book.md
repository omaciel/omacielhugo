title: Free Visual Basic 2005 Book

Thought I'd share with my fellow programmers my latest finding:
[Introducing Visual Basic 2005 for
Developers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/whidbey/introto2005/). You
can download the entire book (approx. 15MB) on individual chapters in
PDF format. Now, if Microsoft would only release the bloody thing
already! ;) If anyone know of a similar book for C\#, please post back.
