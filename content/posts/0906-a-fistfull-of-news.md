Been quite busy at work these days, as well as playing the host to my
parents during the holidays. I did keep up with what was happening
around the world, thanks to my G1 (I love this gadget!), and wanted to
share a few nice nuggets.

-   First of all, the birth of
    [Lotte](http://blog.transifex.net/2009/05/introducing-lotte/), the
    online translation editor! This new feature will help the
    [Transifex](http://www.transifex.org) guys deliver a fatal 1,2 punch
    combination in the fight against bad translation tools and
    processes!

-   As if Dimitris and his crew didn't have enough on their plate (I
    tell you, they have macchiato running through their veins), a new
    fledgling [web portal](http://www.transifex.net) portal for
    translators is in the makings. Think of a place where translators
    can offers their skills to projects in need of translators and you
    can see where this could lead.
-   Still speaking of translations, hanging out on \#transifex on
    Freenode I picked up that the
    [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/) guys really like
    Transifex and what it has to offer their current legion of
    translators! Sounds like some experimenting may take place soon
    between these 2 projects (I'll keep my fingers crossed!).
-   On a different subject, I have started working on a **Snowy
    Appliance** yesterday and will have something done and consumable by
    this weekend. Don't know what [snowy](http://live.gnome.org/Snowy)
    is? Then check **Paul Cutler**\'s blog
    [post](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/silwenae/~3/83IvWoG-rUM/) and
    the links within it. Want to lend me a hand? Ping me on IRC, email,
    comment here, [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/OgMaciel), etc, etc.
-   I'm running this year for the [GNOME Board of
    Directors](http://foundation.gnome.org/elections/overview.html)!
    Take a look at the [list of
    candidates](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2009-May/msg00037.html)
    and if you're a **GNOME Foundation** member, remember to vote! If
    you're not a member, what are you waiting for?
-   My **35th** birthday is fast approaching (June 8th actually) and I
    will be updating my
    [wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/wishlist/32BX7VP2GEFI1) juuuuust in
    case someone feels like surprising me, *hint hint*
