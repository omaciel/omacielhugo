title: Pastebin as a Linux Appliance
---

My co-worker [Elliot Peele](http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/elliot)
just released the [Pastebin
Appliance](http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/pastebin/release?id=5225)
using [rBuilder Online](http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/) and
[conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary). This is actually pretty
cool and it will be extremely useful for those who want to have the
features of a pastebin but don't want to roll up their sleeves and
install all the necessary pieces from scratch. You could even have it
running on vmware and use it as such!

I'm sure that in a not so distant future people will really take
advantage of virtualization and Linux appliances. It will be like having
a computer system where the operating system is irrelevant and people
will be able to pop in/out whatever features they want in the same
manner one changes drill bits while doing some work in the house. Need a
MythTV-like system? Pop the right appliance in and off you go! Need a
robust \[Oracle \| MySQL \| Postgres\] database server? You get the
gist. ;)
