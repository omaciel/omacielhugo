With the soon to be released GNOME version 2.24, you'll find the new
version for [Cheese](http://www.gnome.org/projects/cheese/), a pretty
slick application that "allows you to take photos, videos, and anything
else you can think of with your webcam." My kids and I have spent quite
some time playing with the special effects, often combining a bunch of
them to see who could come up with the silliest shot.

When [Daniel](http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel/) asked me if he could use
some of my shots to create a
[tour](http://www.gnome.org/projects/cheese/tour.html) for the new
release, it gave us one more reason to play with Cheese.

If you haven't already checked it, I recommend it but be warned: your
kids will most likely take over the computer for a few hours! :)
