title: Desktop client for Twitter and Identi.ca
---

I've been using Ping.FM to update my Twitter and Identi.ca accounts for
the last 2 weeks. That is all good and great but I needed a way to read
the replies and feeds from those 2 accounts as well! My "solution" was
to keep 3 tabs open in my browser and periodically refresh those pages
to see if there was anything new. In comes Gwibber. It wasn't until last
night that I found out we had it packaged in our repositories (the
WebKit branch) so today I decided to give it a go.

> [Gwibber](https://launchpad.net/gwibber) is an open source
> microblogging client for GNOME developed with Python and GTK. It
> supports Twitter, Jaiku, Identi.ca, Facebook, and Digg.

So far it is updating me with the chatter from everyone I follow, which
is exactly what I wanted. I may post again about this tool in the coming
days to follow up.
