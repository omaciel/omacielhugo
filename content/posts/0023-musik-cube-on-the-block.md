After reading about [Musik Cube](http://www.musikcube.com/) on two
different places today I decided to give it a try. I downloaded it at
work from one of the many mirrors and installed it in less than 1
minute. After the initial import process by which [Musik
Cube](http://www.musikcube.com/) extracts and populates itself with the
information from your media files, I was pleased with the simple and
clean UI look. The program "feels" very light, intuitive, and
responsive. Songs fade in and out to the next song by default. Fast and
easy playlist creation. Out of the box [ogg](http://www.vorbis.com/)
support. I think I can now give [WinAmp](http://www.winamp.com) Lite a
well deserved rest!
