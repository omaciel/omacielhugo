![Week in Review](http://bit.ly/DogReview)

**Three more days until my birthday**! Want to take a look at my [wish
list](http://amzn.to/OgWishList)? ;)

ï»¿ï»¿Hereâ€™s what happened this week:

# [Not Going to GUADEC 2010](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1099)

After several weeks agonizing over how to afford a trip to
attendÂ **GUADEC 2010**, I have finally arrived at the conclusion that I
wonâ€™t be able to make it. Due to my current financial situation\[...\]

# [Emmaâ€™s Very Busy Week](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1101)

Iâ€™m the proud father of two voracious young readers! From very early
on I was able to instill into my daughters the pleasure of reading
books. They also happen to be girly girls, so while most kids ask for
toys and video games for their birthdays\[...\]
