Funny [write

comparing the 3 most used web search engines to world countries:

\[snip\]

> **Microsoft is Germany**. They did some pretty evil things a while
> back but you don't remember the details, you just know that you really
> hate them...

\[snip\]

> **Yahoo is Japan**. It had an economic crisis that almost destroyed it
> and it plays too nice with all of the other evil empires, supporting
> the most evil endeavors...

\[snip\]

> **Google is the United States**. It has never seen trouble on home
> turf. It is arrogant and loved by the elite.

I wonder what search engine Brazil would be???
