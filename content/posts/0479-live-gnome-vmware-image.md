Want to see what the new GNOME 2.18 will be like and can't wait for the
release date? Don't feel like rolling up your sleeves and compiling it
from source? Have no fear!!!

[Ken Vandine](http://ken.vandine.org/?p=215) has packaged GNOME 2.17.92
as a VMware image, which can be downloaded
[here](http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5402).
Experience GNOME (in english only for now) with all of its components
packed into a mere **362Â MB**, including VMware Tools!!! All of this
goodness thanks to the powers of
[Conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary)!
