title: GUADEC 2007
---

After being harassed by **Mario Danic** for several days to submit a
paper to this year's **GUADEC**, I caved in and did it. I had problems
completing my registration but was rescued in the last minute by [Thomas
Wood](http://blogs.gnome.org/portal/thos)!

If my [paper](http://www.guadec.org/node/601) gets selecte, my talk will
be titled "Where the streets have no name: Getting more done with
different localizations teams!", and it will be based on my personal
experience in coordinating the joint effort by the Brazilian GNOME and
Ubuntu Localization teams during our race toward a 100% GNOME 2.18
Desktop in Brazilian Portuguese.

I'll keep my fingers crossed! ;)
