Here's a picture of yours truly at age \~10-11 (I'm the guy in the
middle). My younger sister (the one wearing green) decided to "baptize"
her doll and convinced our mom to "throw a party"... and that's what she
got!!! I was the "priest" and the "couple" to the left were the
"godparents." We had lots of real food and drinks... everything
decorated too!!!

Man, how great were those days! Not a single worry on my mind and lots
of playing time!
