title: Get your pork right here!
---

This is
[disgusting](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/bailout.pork/index.html)!
If you're still one of those who think that the bailout plan is for the
good of the entire nation with no hidden agendas, think again! Bundled
in the bailout plan there are several **ridiculous** provisions that
will cost you and me several **billion dollars**! Sure they've added a
few sweetners to the deal, but why not then create a single, clean piece
of legislation to deal with the major issue? Both Obama and MacCain
approved this last night too... Disgusting!
