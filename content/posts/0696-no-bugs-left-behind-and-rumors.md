title: No Bugs Left Behind and Rumors
---

Today I started a [No Bugs Left
Behind](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/?p=11) campaign to air
out any kinks out of **BillReminder**. Though I was very busy at work, I
managed to file a couple of
[issues](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161428&atid=819795)
with several of them being resolved by **Luiz** before the end of the
day! I had some positive feedback from people who tried the Mandriva
package and even a \*.deb too. Hope to fix some other pending issues
over the weekend.

On unrelated news, rumor has it that we will have the very first
**Foresight Summit** coming to Raleigh, NC toward the end of March. It
should be very exciting as we'll have most of our developers at hand,
including our own [AntÃƒÂ³nio "doniphon"
Meireles](http://web.foresightlinux.org/planet/user/4)! Hope to see some
friendly faces as well... Yeah, I'm talking to you
[nixternal](http://blog.nixternal.com/) and
[Jorge](http://stompbox.typepad.com/blog/)!
