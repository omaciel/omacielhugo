Lunch time here at [BarCampRDU](http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU), and the
food selection was AWESOME! We had a great variety of Mediterranean food
and it reminded me a lot of the food we have at the Mediterranean Deli
in Chapel Hill! Good opportunity to chit-chat and goof off, specially if
you happen to sit next to [devnet](http://lindox.org)!
