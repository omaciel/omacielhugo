title: Lessons I learned as a translation guy
---

This post is my 2 cents about Jad's latest post trying to [stir things
up and attract more
translators](http://syntux.net/blog/2008/08/28/boosting-the-translation-process/)
to the Ubuntu community! Having led the Brazilian team for a couple of
years myself, I wanted to point out a couple of things Iâ€™ve learned
along the way. Obviously advices are best taken when asked for, but here
it goes anyway:

-   Beware that 300 volunteers working at the same time without a robust
    and clear way of knowing whoâ€™s doing what will make it impossible
    for your team to manage;
-   Also, with this many people contributing with single, hand picked
    strings is extremelly detrimental to the overal quality of the
    entire package, not to mention the entire suite;
-   I have always liked the idea of contributions being done upstream
    first, and then tricklying it down to distros and what not. It is my
    dream and goal to make sure that Ubuntu reverses this trend and
    start sending contributions upstream (translations). Check out my
    blueprint:

Well, back to work I go. :)
