As pointed out by [Jonathan
Carter](http://jonathancarter.co.za/python-magazine), the first issue of
[Python Magazine](http://www.pythonmagazine.com/c/issue/2007/10) has
been published and can be freely downloaded. I took a fairly quick
glimpse at the articles and was very pleased with the amount of (sample)
code included! I would definitely pay for its subscription and have
added it to my (short) list of things I'd like to have (but cannot
afford to at the moment). My other item in this list? A subscription to
the awesome [Linux Format](http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/) magazine! :)
