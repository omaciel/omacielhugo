title: BillReminder has a new house!
---

My pet project [BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org)
has gone through several iterations of new code these last few days,
mainly thanks to the work done by **Luiz Armesto**. All this commotion
made me finally move the project's home page, then hosted by
SourceForge, to one of my domains. This has given me more flexibility
and control over the overall design and look and feel of it.

Speaking of look and feel, I have received some spiffy artwork (namely,
the header) from **VinÃƒÂ­cius Amaral** who was fairly excited about the
project. So much so that he is now in charge of this facet of the
project. :)

I have also received a RPM package for Mandriva by **Felipe Rafailov**,
based on an earlier snapshot of the up and coming 0.3 branch. Anyone
interested in taking it for a spin?

Finally, our road map is looking better and better and I got the feeling
that I'll be releasing **BillReminder** before my planned Feb. 15th
date!

The stable **0.1.1** version is currently available for Arch and
Foresight Linux, and canÃ‚Â  be installed using their respective package
management systems.
