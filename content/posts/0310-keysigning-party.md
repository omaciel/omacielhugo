[David Harding](http://gnuisance.net/blog/) is organizing a [keysigning
party](http://gnuisance.net/blog/2006/May/13#gpgwisdom.1) for this June
14th, right after the [LUG/IP](http://lugip.org/) meeting.Ã‚Â  I'm not
sure I'll be able to attend it, but I'll definitely try my best!Ã‚Â  I
do have some friends in the Princenton area and could use this chance to
meet them over *coff*Ã‚Â  coffee *coff*.Ã‚Â  :)

On a different note, this blog is now syndicated at
[GnuJersey.org](http://gnujersey.org/).Ã‚Â  I just love the Ubuntu and
RHCE badges next to my posts!Ã‚Â  ;)
