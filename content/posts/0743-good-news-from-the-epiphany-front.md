title: Good news from the Epiphany front
---

Very cool
[news](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/epiphany-list/2008-April/msg00000.html)
from the land of the [Epiphany](http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany) web
browser this morning. Their decision to go with WebKit plus the
synchronization with GNOME's release cycle should appeal to a lot of new
developers and contributors! If we could finally get [Firebug for
Epiphany](http://live.gnome.org/action/diff/SummerOfCode2008/Ideas)
(this GSoC idea needs a mentor!!!) I could stop using two different
browsers. :)
