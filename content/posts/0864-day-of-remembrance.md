I'd like to second [Davyd's](http://davyd.livejournal.com/264221.html)
post about the [10th Day of
Remembrance](http://www.transgenderdor.org/). It pains me to know that
even today with all the technological and intellectual progress we've
made, there are people out there who just cannot accept and/or respect
other people's choices.

For those hiding behind a bible to defend their actions, maybe your god
should teach you more tolerance...

Yeah, comments will be turned off. I don't plan to spend my day fending
off any comment that will tell me that their rights are more important
that somebody else's.
