title: XFCE completely translated to Brazilian Portuguese
---

I'm extremely proud to announce that the [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org)
desktop environment, well known for being a lighter alternative to
**GNOME** or **KDE**, is completely translated (upstream) to Brazilian
Portuguese!

A total of over 80 different programs and components off the XFCE and
Goodies repositories, with over 6000 strings, I believe that XFCE is the
first complex desktop environment to be completely translated to
Brazilian Portuguese! The core components had been 100% translated for
about 1 week now, as can be see in the stats
[page](http://i18n.xfce.org/stats/index.php?mode=4&lang=trunk/pt_BR),
mas yesterday I finished my research and noticed that all the other
components were also finished. Now I get to keep my eye on any changes
that may happen until the 4.4.6 release takes place.
