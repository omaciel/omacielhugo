So says my good friend
[Gerrard](http://www.pickabar.com/blog/archives/2006/04/ive_got_bad_new.html)
with his new catchy
[tune](http://www.pickabar.com/music/Pickabar%20-%20Youre%20Dying.mp3)!Ã‚Â 
He never ceases to amaze me with his multi talents!

On a different note, tomorrow I'll be attending the [Northern NJ MySQL
Group](http://mysql.meetup.com/23/) meeting at the Panera Bread in
Paramus.Ã‚Â  Got lots of books to distribute from O'Reilly and Apress
too!Ã‚Â  Should be lots of fun!

Work has kept me really busy these last 2-3 weeks...Ã‚Â  Too bad it is
not new development...Ã‚Â  Going over thousands of Java, PL/SQL, and
T-SQL spagethi code looking for some obscure logic is not what I call
fun...Ã‚Â  Got a few phone calls from headhunters but nothing I'd be
interested in doing...
