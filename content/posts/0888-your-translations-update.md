Proud to have been a part of delivering the following upstream projects
100% translated to Brazilian Portuguese:

-   **GNOME** 2.26 UI: 100%
    [translated](http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/pt_BR/gnome-2-26/ui/).
-   **Xfce** 4.6 UI: 100%
    [translated](http://i18n.xfce.org/stats/?lang=pt_BR&branch=xfce%2Ftrunk)
-   **Openbox**: 100% translated

I also helped the GNOME Italian team with their commits.

Now, onto **LXDE** and some modules for **Fedora**.
