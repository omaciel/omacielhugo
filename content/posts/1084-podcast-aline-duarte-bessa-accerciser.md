Another episode of my [Cast√°lio Podcast](http://castalio.info), this
time with **Aline Duarte Bessa**, another Brazilian who is participating
of the [GNOME Women Outreach
Program](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeWomen/OutreachProgram2011)
(**GWOP**). Even with a fever, cold e technical issues getting a working
system to record this show, she was gracious to spend some of her free
time and tell me about her current task of updating the developer's
documentation for **Accerciser**.

The episode, recorded in Brazilian Portuguese, can be downloaded
