Been really enjoying my [SeaGate Portable
Drive](http://www.seagate.com/products/retail/portable/index.html). I
managed to upload all my 13Â GB+ of MP3s and Oggs together with a bunch
of usefull applications and code I was carrying with me on a couple of
CDs for quite some time. Having a central and portable repository for
all of my music, documents, and code is something I've wanted for the
longest time. I have also started to use the
[portable](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox/) version
of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html),
which contrary to the "normal" version runs off of a portable device and
not a (non-portable) hard drive. This has allowed me to keep all of my
bookmarks in one place and use my browser of choice no matter where I'm
connected to. In fact, I'm very interested to learn of other portable
applications to increase my arsenal. Does anyone know of a good portable
media player with good support for mp3s and oggs??? How about other
"indispensable" applications that can be run off of a portable device???
