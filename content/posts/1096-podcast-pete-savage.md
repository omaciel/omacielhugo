For those who follow my many different projects and enterprises, you
probably already know that I have been hosting a podcast called
[Castálio Podcast](http://www.castalio.info/), a bi-weekly show where I
interview people from the **Brazilian FOSS** world and talk about their
likes, dislikes and what events and factors shaped their lives!

When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an episode in
English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an overwhelming
'**Yes**!'

So for my very first episode in English I chose to interview a good
friend of mine from several years: **Pete Savage**! During the next 58
minutes we talked about how we first met through a **PyGtk** video he
posted a while back during a **Linux User Group**meeting, how he first
got involved with **Edubuntu**, and then moved on to several other
projects such as **ProgBox** and \**GeekDeck, about the books that he's
written including the reason for writing "Emblem Divide", how much
the Japanese culture*\* plays a role in his daily life, and his **Top
5** movies, books and movies! While the episodes' in English future are
yet to be determined, this latest episode can be downloaded
