Yes, I'm still alive and kicking. Been really busy at work and haven't
had the time or energy to write anything here. I have however kept my
**New Year's resolution** of reading a book during lunch break every
day! I'm currently reading 2 books at the same time (check what other
books I have read and those I have still waiting on my queue in the
front page of my blog):

-   **For The Win** by Cory Doctorow
-   **The Fourth Part of the World** by Toby Lester

I feel that it is impossible to read Doctorow's book and not feel the
urge to play [World of
Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml) (WoW). Impossible! I
think the last time I played this game I still lived in **Northern New
Jersey** and was an **Ubuntu user** (yeah, I've matured since then).

So I wanted to play WoW really bad after reading a chapter but wasn't
sure how to do it since I only run **GNU/Linux** and didn't feel like
setting up a **Windows VM** just to play a game! Talking to my long time
friend [Vinny](http://awkward-silence.com/) I suddenly realized that I
never tried to run the game using [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/), so I
decided that once I got home I'd take it for a spin.

After downloading a 3.3MB installer from Blizzard, and installing Wine
(*sudo conary update wine*), I went ahead and ran *wineÂ TryWoW.exe*.
What followed was a series of screens where I simply accepted the
defaults and clicked my way through. There were times when a dialog with
no messages popped up where all you could do was click on the OK
button... so I did.

The installation did require access to the internet and a bundle of
approximately 35MB was downloaded in the process. Once the wizard
finished I had the option to play the game right there and then! How
exciting!

The game takes a few extra seconds to start but eventually I was face to
face with the login window. However, I noticed that I had no audio and
the video quality lacked a bit. Googling around brought me to
theseÂ [instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft).
So I modified my configuration file to include:

> SET gxApi "opengl" SET Sound_SoundOutputSystem "1" SET
> Sound_SoundBufferSize "150"

That was it!!! I spent the next 45 minutes playing the game using my
trial account and had to be dragged by my wife and kids to the kitchen
to eat diner with them! :)

I'm very satisfied with the experience and extremely pleased with the
stability of Wine! Since I have 2 monitors at home, my game window shows
up in one monitor while my "normal" desktop is on the other and I have
to be careful not to click outside of the game. If I do, then I cannot
go back into the game again and have to kill the process and start over.

Well, I still have a few more days until my trial period expires. Will I
then update to a full blown account and waste spend my free time
investing on my character? To be determined! :)
