title: I screwed up!
---

I officially screwed up my site!!! I completely fucked it up!!! It turns
out the instructions on how to upgrade
[WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) to version 1.5 are incorrect and I
ended up deleting ALL of my posts! Hopefully I can get a copy of the
most recent backup, assuming there is one to get! I know some of you are
probably saying: "Hey idiot!!! Did you remember to back up everything
**before** upgrading???" Obviously, the answer is "No!" This is not the
first time I upgrade my blog and the instructions were very much right
on the money before...

Oh well, let's see what happens now.
