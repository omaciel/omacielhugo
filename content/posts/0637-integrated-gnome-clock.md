So today Ken Vandine was showing off the integration of intlclock with
his GNOME clock applet:

I clicked on my clock to find out, to my surprise, that all of my tasks
on Tasks and appointments in Zimbra were nicely integrated with it!

| It would be really nice to integrate BillReminder with it too... :)
