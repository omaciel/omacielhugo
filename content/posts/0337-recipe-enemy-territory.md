First of all, I want to thank all the kind comments on my previous post.
:) To show my appreciation, here is something for those days when you
can hardly think straight...

**Enemy Territory**

![image0](http://static.flickr.com/5/5302784_a102a7eedb.jpg)**Utensils:**

-   You should have a Nvidia or ATI card and driverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦
-   and libgtk1.2: sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2

**Ingredients:**

-   Download the game from your favorite gaming site orÃ¢â‚¬Â¦

    > wget -c
    > <http://ftp.games.skynet.be/pub/wolfenstein/et-linux-2.60.x86.run>

-   Apply any patch you can find in the same site orÃ¢â‚¬Â¦

    > wget -c
    > <http://ftp.games.skynet.be/pub/wolfenstein/et-linux-2.60-update.x86.run>

**Preparation:**

-   In a deep pan, execute the installation program as such:

    > sudo sh ./et-linux-2.60.x86.run

Immediately, a smaller window with installation instructions will
pop-up. Choosing the default options should be enough for now.

-   Now, carefully add a dash of patch, using the following command:

    > sudo sh ./et-linux-2.60-update.x86.run

**Serving:**

After cooking it up on low for some minutes, serve the main dish with
the following command:

> et

Alternativally, you could serve it on a nice porcelain dish, accessing
it from the menu Applications -\> Other -\> enemy-territory. I'm sure
all your guests will praise you for your culinary skills! **Buon
Apetit**!!!
