title: Say Hello To My New Little Friend
---

Had a great surprise when I arrived home from work last night! My good
friends from [MeeGo](http://meego.com/) sent me a little something to
help me with the translation work I have done for them.

Since my in-laws were also at my house I decided to wait until they had
left to properly enjoy opening it. A couple of agonizing hours later I
finally shredded the box to pieces to reveal: a **HP Mini N470**!

The system came with **Windows 7** pre-installed (which felt pretty good
to be honest) but it will be shortly re-installed with the upcoming
**Meego** release as soon as it becomes available! So from now on I
won't be doing "blind translations" anymore and will be able to dog food
my translations to **Brazilian Portuguese**!

I just wanted to say that this is a very nice gesture and acknowledges
that the time I have spent not only translating but also helping
organize the translation effort for **Meego** is appreciated. From the
bottom of my heart, t**hank you**! You know who you are! :)
