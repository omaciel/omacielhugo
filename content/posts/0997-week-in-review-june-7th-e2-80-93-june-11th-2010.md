![Week in Review](http://bit.ly/DogReview)

**Three more days until my birthday**! Want to take a look at my [wish
list](http://amzn.to/OgWishList)? ;)

It was a very busy week, so I didn't spend the same amount of time
writing as the previous weeks. Thank you for the kind wishes on my
**birthday**! :)

Also, thank you **Conzar**, [Aigars Mahinovs](http://aigarius.com),
[Paulo Dias](http://padoca.wordpress.com), [Tassos
Bassoukos](http://tassos.blogentis.net) and [Rodney
Dyer](http://dyerlab.bio.vcu.edu) for the awesome tips related to
playing **World of Warcraft** on Linux! :)

# [Playing World of Warcraft on Linux with Wine](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1108)

Yes, Iâ€™m still alive and kicking. Been really busy at work and
havenâ€™t had the time or energy to write anything here. I have however
kept myÂ **New Yearâ€™s resolution** of reading a book during lunch
break every day! Iâ€™m currently reading 2 books at the same time (check
what other books I have read and those I have still waiting on my queue
in the front page of my blog):

-   **For The Win** by Cory Doctorow
-   **The Fourth Part of the World** by Toby Lester

I feel that it is impossible to read Doctorowâ€™s book and not feel the
urge to playÂ [World of
Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml) (WoW). Impossible! I
think the last time I played this game\[...\]
