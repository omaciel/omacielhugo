Once again I have
[solid](http://rodrigo.gnome-db.org/news.php?20/April/2005) proof that
there are better ways of "team building" than what I've experienced so
far in my short career as a developer. It used to be that the IT group
of any organization ruled, getting a lot of respect and perks along the
way. Not so anymore\... at least around here\... More and more our
sub-divisions (i.e. Operations, Developers, DB Admin, etc) are growing
apart and there's just too much "statics" in the sole communication
channel. Even within sub-divisions there's not much appreciation by our
superiors\... "You want a 17-inch monitor because you think your 13-inch
is straining your eyes??? Go back to your cubicle and write 25,000 lines
of code for that!" The sad thing is that after a while you get used to
it\... Almost as if numb to it all.

When I visited Ximian's office in Cambridge, MA this last February I was
awaken from this deep slumber! I had heard of places, in a far, far way
land, where developers get the best computers with lots of RAM and even
a sound card!!! Where coffee flows in abundance and there's even a
choice of decaf for those who have been in the front for too long\...
Ximian's place was just like that\... with more! They had a foosball
table\... and, and\... couches\... and, and\... free pizza! I thought it
was a mirage!!! THAT is the kind of place I'd like to work for! Not only
you get to work on what you like but you get paid for it and the perks
too!
