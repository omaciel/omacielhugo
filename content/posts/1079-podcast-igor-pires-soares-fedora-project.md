title: "Podcast: Igor Pires Soares - Fedora Project"
---

I had a chance to interview [Igor Pires Soares](http://igorsoares.com/)
from the **Fedora Project** and chat about how he got started with
translations, participating on several organizing committees and his
travels around the world! He talks about **getting lost in Chile**,
learning English and Spanish, the role his university played on his
career, his top 5 books, movies and his interest in music, including a
very special moment during a **U2 show in SÃ£o Paulo**. The interview is
in Brazilian Portuguese, but anyone who can speak Portuguese or Spanish
should be able to enjoy it!
