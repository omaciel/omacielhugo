title: "What's The Frequency, Kenneth?"

The depth of the WWW never ceases to amaze me. Every day there's a new
world out there for you to discoverer! I do browse a handfull of sites
every day religiously but sometimes I crave for new material. Reading
blogs have given me the opportunity to "interact" with a much larger
audience with an even wider and diverse background... and tastes... and
points of view... About 2 days ago I came across [Stephen
O'Grady](http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/)\'s blog and was hooked to his
style of writing immediately. Today\'s entry titled "On Blogs,
Multi-Tasking and Continuous Partial Attention" was very, but very
interesting for it touched upon a subject that has been afflicting me
for quite some time now:

> I simply have too much to do. Too much to read, too much to write, too
> much everything. This fact is as immutable as the laws of
> thermodynamics. While there's always room for improvement in my
> overall efficiency, ultimately the equation is simple: the information
> to free time ratio is solidly tilted in the direction of the former.

Ever since I joined "corporate America" shortly after college my life
has turned completely upside down. I feel like I'm living inside Pink
Floyd's The Wall music video. Every day you take your place on this
conveyor belt inside a huge assembly line and like sheep move, slowly
but surely toward the abattoir. There's just so much to do and so little
time. 24 hours are not enough to get everything done in one days... and
that is not including the things YOU really want to do. Everything is
timed. Your bathroom breaks are timed. No, there's nobody following me
with a stopwatch timing my every minute. The timing is actually done by
my own self... My (un)concious way of making sure I don't "waste" to
much time just sitting in the John. I don't remember the last time I
took a nice and long bath... Or the last time I just sat outside and
watched the sky at night... The little voice inside my head keeps
telling me: "What??? **Watch** the sky??? Couldn't you do something
else, like folding your clothes or cooking enough food that will last 2
days so you don't have to cook after you get home at 7pm??? And don't
they have a DVD for those who like to watch the sky anyway???" Maybe I
should litteraly unplug myself! It is one alternative I'm yet to try...
Stop myself from trying to multitask every thing I do... Take the time
to completely focus on something that I enjoy doing 100%... like
fishing...
