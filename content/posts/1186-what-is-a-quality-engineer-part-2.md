title: Just What Is A Quality Engineer? Part 2

The [last
time](https://omaciel.github.io/just-what-is-a-quality-engineer-part-1.html)
I wrote about **Quality Engineering**, I mentioned that some of the
reasons why people are not familiar with this term are, in no particular
order:

-   \'Quality\' is usually something that is added as an after thought
    and doesn\'t really come into the picture, if ever, until the very
    end of the release process
-   Nobody outside of a QA team really knows what they do. It has
    something to do with testing\...
-   Engineering is usually identified with skills related to writing
    code and designing algorithms, usually by a developer and not by QA

A quick search on Google shows the following results:

-   104,000,000 hits for \"Software Engineer\"
-   86,900,000 hits for "Quality Control"
-   83,100,000 hits for "Quality Assurance"
-   5,390,000 hits for "Quality Engineer"

As you can see, it is no wonder that whenever I say \'quality engineer\'
people always think that what I really meant to say was \'quality
assurance\' or \'quality control\'. The term is just not that
well-known! So in order to clarify what the difference is between these
professions, today I\'d like to talk a little bit about **quality
assurance** and what I usually think whenever someone tells me that they
either work in QA or have a \'QA team\'.

Wikipedia tells us that the terms \'quality assurance\' (QA) and
\'quality control\' (QC) are often used interchangeably to refer to ways
of ensuring the quality of a service or product.

Furthermore,

> \"Quality assurance comprises administrative and procedural activities
> implemented in a quality system so that **requirements** and goals for
> a product, service or activity will be **fulfilled**. It is the
> systematic **measurement**, **comparison** with a standard,
> **monitoring** of processes and an associated **feedback loop** that
> confers **error prevention**.\" \--
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance)

That is quite a mouth full (the emphasized words are mine), but I feel
that it does a good job at stating the following ideas:

-   Quality Assurance and/or Quality Control is used to assure the
    quality of a product, but there is no clear distinction as to when
    in the release process it should be used. In my experience, it
    usually happens when the product is close to being shipped!
-   Used to make sure that **requirements** (the what) are **fulfilled**
    (the how)
-   Used to measure, monitor and compare results against a standard
-   Used for error preventions (which to me denotes a reactive mode
    compared to a proactive mode)

In other words, those who do quality assurance for a living are involved
in verifying that the final version of the product being tested delivers
exactly what was designed with the expected behavior and outcome. It
requires that the QA person fully understand what is being added to or
changed in the product and, most importantly, what the end result should
be. Testing is definitely a big part of the \'day to day\' activities
for someone in QA, which does provide useful information to create a
positive feedback loop and hopefully increase error prevention.

Here\'s what I don\'t like about this whole business though:

Quality is something that must be part of all phases of a product and
**not** at the very end of the process. A good QA person is usually so
familiar with the product being tested that one could say that QA **is**
the first customer a company has! If you have someone in your team who
can fully understand how your product works, where the pain points are,
knows at a glance if a new feature or a fix does not follow the existing
standards, and has the ability to tell you if something doesn\'t feel
right, would you want to hear this type of feedback at the very end? By
then, can you really afford to put things on hold and re-design your
product??? In my experience, the answer to this question has 99.99% of
the time been \'No\'.

Quality is the responsibility of everyone involved with a product and
not only of those in QA! Everyone, document writers, translators, user
experience (UX) experts, product managers, you name it, everyone should
be in the business of delivering and assuring the quality of the
product! If you bought something, would you be OK with accepting
mediocre user experience, documentation, features and translations? I
doubt it.

Monitoring and measuring how a product compares against some set of
standardized benchmarks is definitely important but as customers request
more and more new features and the product\'s complexity increases, are
your benchmarks also keeping up with all these changes? More
importantly, since **you** are the one using the product day and night,
do you have any input into updating the benchmarks? I certainly hope so.

Lastly, if your job is to make sure that no product \'goes out the
door\' without a thorough validation, that it works as expected and that
all known issues have been fixed, aren\'t you forgetting something? What
about the issues that are not known yet? You may be thinking that I\'m
joking, but seriously. If all you do is prevent errors from being
shipped to your customers, how about detecting them as early as possible
to give all major stake-holders enough time to make a decision as to
what should be done with them? Again, if you\'re catching them at the
end of the release cycle, it could be too late.

If your company has a QA team, then you\'re already ahead of the game,
since it is only when customer dissatisfaction is very high and the
final numbers for the quarter start to look gloomy that people start
paying attention to delivering quality. But it is not enough if you\'re
only kicking the can down the road only to find yourself facing the same
scenario later on! Quality, good quality, is what everyone in your team
should be striving for\... not some times, but all the time!

If you are in a QA team, do you ever feel like you\'re ahead of the game
or feel like you\'re constantly playing catch up? Do you wish you could
have a chance to catch issues as early as possible? Wouldn\'t you want
to stop racing against the clock to get issues verified and have a shot
at doing more exploratory testing and identify problems early on? Would
you say \'no\' to an opportunity to provide some insight into how the
product could be improved and perhaps how some work-flows could be
simplified to increase the usability?

It should be clear by now that quality is something that should be
something systemic for any project or company who takes their customer
satisfaction as their top priority! Sure you can test the product as
much as you (or your QA team) can handle, but you\'d be only treating
the symptoms. Maintaining a \'quality first\' mentality and improving
existing processes to make sure that quality is an integral part of
everyone\'s day to day activities is primordial if you really want to
make a bigger impact!

This is when a Quality Engineer comes in! A Quality Engineer is someone
who can actively and continuously keep driving improvements to the
release cycle process and are in the unique position to help the entire
team adopt these improvements so that everyone is using the same
methodologies.

Next time I will then talk about **quality engineering** (QE), what it
is, what it isn\'t, and how you should be either hiring more QE or, if
you\'re in QA, how you should be working to become a QE!

As always, please let me know what your thoughts are on this topic as
I\'d live to get some constructive feedback!
