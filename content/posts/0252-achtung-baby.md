Been away from this blog for quite some time now. Obviously, a great
deal of events have taken place, and I intend to talk about most of
them, eventually...

The one thing that I'm most proud of however, is my most recent
achievement: my Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) certification! This
was one of my most coveted plans for the year and I'm extremelly excited
and relieved for achieving this milestone! I worked hard for 2 straight
weeks trying my best to grasp all of the new (to me, for I'm a software
guy) hardware related subjects that were expected to be in the exam.

I must admit that having [Evan McNabb](http://evan.mcnabbs.org/) around
helped a whole lot! He radiates his enthusiasm for Linux and Open
Source, and you'd have to be completely numb not to be affected by it!

What's next? I'd actually like to find a new job as a Linux
Administrator or Developer to gain more experience with some of the
enterprise facets of IT that I haven't had a chance to be exposed to
yet... and hopefully become an Open Source Strategist and get paid for
doing what I really love!
