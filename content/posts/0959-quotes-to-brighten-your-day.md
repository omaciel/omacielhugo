Kind of ironic how my post titled "[Stop whining and improve your
life](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=884)\" attracted so much negativity in
the comments area. It became very clear to me, however, that most were
just too eager to make assumptions about my intention or probably wanted
to vent a bit. Those who know me personally or have followed my blog for
a while know that I don't live in a fantasy world (though sometimes
Chapel Hill can feel that way) filled with unicorn and cotton candy
clouds. I'll save myself the hassle and will just point the naysayers to
what [Vinny](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=884#comment-6537) and
[Paul](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=884#comment-6519) had to say.

Anyhow, I wanted to share a couple of quotes that sort of inspire me to
be a better person and help me focus on what really matters. Most, if
not all, came from "[This Year I
Will...](http://www.amazon.com/This-Year-Will-Finally-Resolution/dp/0767920082/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1271125776&sr=8-1)\"

a light but pleasant reading for a lazy afternoon. I sincerely hope
you'll enjoy them too.
