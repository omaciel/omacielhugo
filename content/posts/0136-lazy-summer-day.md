title: Lazy Summer Day
---

Spent a uneventful and quiet day with my dad. Played a bit of tennis in
the park and had BBQ for lunch. Got an email from a
[friend](http://www.kaegisllc.com) who got free wi-fi while on the beach
in Atlantic City. Bastard! :) I'm still a bit sore but managed to catch
some quality Zs last night. My younger sister is in town so it should be
a fun weekend.
