Just like a teenager who's about to get his driver's license for the
first time, I was as nervous as one can be early this morning (14:00
UTC), while attending my first [Ubuntu
Council](https://launchpad.net/people/communitycouncil) meeting. One of
the subjects to be discussed was my possible membership to the [Ubuntu
Members Team](https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntumembers). Topic after
topic were brought up and dealt with... and as the minutes passed on by,
I could barely remain calm... I was afraid I'd choke during my
presentation and not say anything useful, but then... a huge calm came
over me... and I spoke! With passion! With conviction!

When the smoke cleared and all the dust settled (and after I was dragged
off the stage, gagged and tied up so to shut my mouth), I was informed
that I had been granted the membership! It was a very exciting moment
for me and it touched me to hear the type of compliments I received for
my involvement so far!

Just as any "award" show, one has to finish it off with a "thank you"
note... so, in no particular order...

Thank you:

-   sh
-   rbelem
-   segfault
-   MarioMeyer
-   Seveas

Specially, my wife and daughter for putting up with this husband/father
who spends way too much time glued to the PC... and takes every
opportunity to teach them that Open Source is the way to go!

... and everyone who's supported me these last months and the members of
the council for seeing the potential I believe I have to offer to the
community! My heartfelt eternal gratitude!
