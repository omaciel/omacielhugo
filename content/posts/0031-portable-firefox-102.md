For all you crazy USB-Portable-Device-Lovers out there: [Portable
FireFox 1.0.2](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox/) has
been released!!! My favorite new features are:

> **COMMANDLINE PASSING** - The Portable Firefox launcher now supports
> commandline passing! That's right, you can drag an HTML file onto
> PortableFirefox.exe and drop it and it will open it right up. You can
> even manually set PortableFirefox.exe to be your default browser in
> Windows and it will open up URLs correctly. It will only pass in one
> commandline parameter and it is expecting it to be a URL. For the
> curious developers, I was able to add commandline passing by moving
> all paths in the launcher to relative from the EXE allowing me to
> avoid using the FullPath functions (which break the commandline
> reader). **LOCAL PROFILE ADJUSTMENT** - The new launcher now allows
> you to use your local profile within Portable Firefox. Just copy the
> contents of your local profile into the profile directory within
> Portable Firefox and the Portable Firefox launcher will make the
> necessary adjustments for you. It will not adjust anything within
> prefs.js, though, so some extensions and themes will not work.
