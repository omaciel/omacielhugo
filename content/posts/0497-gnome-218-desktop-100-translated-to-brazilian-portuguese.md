We did it!

/me does [Dora, the
Explorer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_the_Explorer)\'s dance!

GNOME 2.18 Desktop Applications are now completely translated to
Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to the colaborative work between the Ubuntu
and GNOME Brazilian teams! Now, the Ubuntu team will be working hard to
make sure that everything is in sync so that Ubuntu Feisty Fawn will
have a default look and feel in our language as well!

I want to take this chance to congratulate all the hard work done by
both teams, and recognize that together we removed a lot of redundancy
in the process. We will be striving to finish the remaining GNOME
packages, and hopefully have a 2.20 completely translated!

I will be working closely with the Debian localization team in the very
near future to see if we can set up the same type of colaboration and
give the Brazilian localization effort a boost!
