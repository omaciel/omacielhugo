title: Rosetta takes a great step toward supporting upstream
  translations
---

[Danilo Å egan](http://danilo.segan.org/blog/), lead developer for the
[Rosetta](https://www.launchpad.net/rosetta) translation tool sent an
email to the Ubuntu translators list yesterday with some great news
related to the policy of how upstream translations are managed:

> Launchpad Translations has changed the translation precedence policy
> with the December release: now upstream ("packaged") translations will
> be given more priority in specific cases. Yet, Launchpad Translations
> keeps the ability to override any specific upstream translation if so
> is desired. To illustrate when upstream translations have precedence,
> here's an example: 1. GNOME Panel, message "\_Open", untranslated 2.
> Ubuntu GNOME Panel message for "\_Open" is untranslated 3. Someone
> translates Ubuntu message in Launchpad to "\_Foo" 4. Upstream
> translates "\_Open" to "\_Bar" 5. When new upstream translation
> arrives, Launchpad makes "\_Bar" active over "\_Foo" (making "\_Foo" a
> suggestion) Example case where Launchpad translation takes precedence
> is: 1. GNOME Panel, message "\_Open", translated to "Foow" 2. Ubuntu
> GNOME Panel translation for "\_Open" is imported and is now "Foow" 3.
> Someone fixes translation in Ubuntu to "\_Foo" 4. Upstream changes
> translation for "\_Open" to "Foo" 5. When new upstream translation
> arrives, Launchpad keeps "\_Foo" active over upstream's "Foo"

Danilo also left me a comment on my last post, telling me that Rosetta
has supported gettext's context feature for a while now which, if
properly used by the developers, could help giving translators a bit
more context information when doing their thing.

I'm so happy that I could literally cry right now!
