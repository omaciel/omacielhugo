title: Ditching MySQL for PostgreSQL
---

In order to better follow what the [Transifex](http://www.transifex.org)
guys are doing with their development and deployment of
[Transifex.net](http://www.transifex.net/), I have finally made the
switch from **MySQL** to [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) for
the [Transifex
Appliance](https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://www.rpath.org/api/products/transifex).
Luckly I was able to corral **diegobz** during my lunch break and
together we worked out the necessary changes to get things to work (and
caught and fixed a minor issue along the way too!).

In the meantime, the appliance seems to be getting some nice and steady
traffic, which I suspect will only increase, specially when a new
version of **Transifex** hits the streets.

One of the cool new features you can expect is the addition of
**Translation Teams**, yet another way to manage who has access to
translate your project! Want to play with this new feature and also be
the first one to test the new **PostgreSQL** addition? Download the
