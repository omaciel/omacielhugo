title: From The Frying Pan Into The Fire
---

Literally! Spent an agonizing sleep-less night after my surgery
yesterday. My keloids were removed with a CO2 laser and whatever if left
of my earlobes feel as if I had deep fried them in boiling sulfuric
acid! Drinking an extremely cold Cappuccino Blast from Donkey Donuts
helped a bit but later in the evening it was a mix of 2 extra stregth
Tylenols + 1 Motrin that helped ease the pain. Got up early today (since
I couldn't really sleep, unable to shift from the only position I could
be) and what a day it is! My weather applet on my laptop says it is 86Â F
right now. And the weather man says it will go up to the mid 90s! As
funny as this may sound, I bet it is much, much nicer at **work** right
now!
