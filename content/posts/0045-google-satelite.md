Amazing upgrade to the already amazing [Google
Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps) site. Don't really know when it was
implemented but you can now switch from the map view to a **real
satellite view**, down to the street level! I can only imagine the day
you'll be able to have a live feed of traffic conditions via satellite
on your web browser of
[choice](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html)!
