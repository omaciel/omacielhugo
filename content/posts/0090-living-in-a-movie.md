Kinda scary when you can relate your job to a
[movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/):

> **BOB SLYDELL** Y'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying
> to get a feel for how people spend their day. So, if you would, would
> you just walk us through a typical day for you? **PETER** Yeah. **BOB
> SLYDELL** Great. **PETER** Well, I generally come in at least fifteen
> minutes late. I use the side door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh,
> and after that, I just sorta space out for about an hour. **BOB
> PORTER** Space out? **PETER** Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it
> looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after
> lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a given week, I probably do about
> fifteen minutes of real, actual work.
