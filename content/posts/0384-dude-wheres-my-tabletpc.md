title: Dude, Where\'s my TabletPC?
---

It has been a while since I last wrote about my TabletPC.Ã‚Â  About 2-3
weeks ago I managed to install Edgy Knot 1 on it and everything was
a-OK!Ã‚Â  That's when the rug was pulled from under me and I was kindly
asked to return my *precious*.Ã‚Â  Turns out my friend, who lent me the
Tablet, had no authority to do so, and asked me to return it.Ã‚Â  I
confess, I was sad to see it go get a make over and become someone
else's new toy...

Anyhow, the torch has been passed and I'm very glad to inform that my
new friend [Andy Kaplan-Myrth](http://andy.kaplan-myrth.ca/Main/Andy)
has made huge [progress](http://andy.kaplan-myrth.ca/Main/20060814) in
fully Ubuntunizing his TabletPC.Ã‚Â  Give this guy some more time and
I'm sure he'll surprise us very soon with some more good news in the
TabletPC arena. :)
