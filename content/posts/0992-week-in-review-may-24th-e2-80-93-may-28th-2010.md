# [The Maze Runner](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1079)

This past March I started a new routine to my Sunday mornings: shortly
after breakfast with the kids, I flip my laptop open and start reading
theÂ [Books](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/index.html)
section\[...\]

# [Django Developer Kit 1.2.1](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1089)

I have just released theÂ [Django Developer Kit
1.2.1](http://www.rpath.org/web/project/djangodevkit) appliance to match
with the release ofÂ [Django](http://djangoproject.com) **1.2.1**! Check

(well, a passage actually) byÂ [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/)!
The event took place atÂ [Flyleaf Books](http://www.flyleafbooks.com/)
right here in**Chapel Hill**, a charming independent book store\[...\]
