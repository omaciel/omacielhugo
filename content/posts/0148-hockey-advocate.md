Now that all those clowns from the NHL have come to terms with their
differences and a new hockey season has been confirmed for this Fall, I
can officially announce the creation of my brand new blog: [Hockey
Advocate](http://hockeyadvocate.com/)! This is the realization of a
long-term dreamof mine for I'm a complete hockey fanatic and always
wanted to have a web site dedicated to the sport. Being I die-hard [New
Jersey Devils](http://newjerseydevils.com) fan, chances are most of my
posts will be related to their affairs but I'll try to live up to the
blog's title and add comments about "the other teams." ;) I still need
to add a few extra things to the page (such as statistical information,
etc) and some custom made art items. Can someone create a nice banner
for the site? I'll more than gladly advertise the author's page.
