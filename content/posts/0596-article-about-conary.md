Had a really nice surprise waiting for me today at work in the form of
an envelope covered with Brazilian postal stamps.

It was a gift from my friend [Vladimir
Melo](http://vladimirmelo.wordpress.com/), who saw an article written
about the package management system
[Conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary), product from the company I
work for. There was also another article talking about the GNOME 2.18
release and the fact that it was completely translated to the Brazilian
Portuguese language, thanks to the collaborative work of 16 people.
Since I was one of them, it was nice to see our work being recognized
like this.

I immediately gave the magazine to [Ken
Vandine](http://ken.vandine.org/), my co-worker and leader for the
Foresight Linux project. Pretty much all of the GNOME screenshots in the
magazine were taken using the Foresight Live CD and he was really
looking forward to getting a copy of this issue for his collection.
