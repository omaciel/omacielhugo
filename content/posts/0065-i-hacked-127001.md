title: I Hacked 127.0.0.1
---

[Pedro](mailto:ronronchan@9online.fr) has commented on my "A (Not)
Hacker's Tale" post that the original web site where the story was
posted has started selling "I Hacked 127.0.0.1" t-shirts!!! Can anyone
confirm this??? I haven't been able to browse the site for it seems
they've been "*slashdotted*". Someone drop me a line...

**Update:** Finally found it!
