Tomorrow I'll be travelling once again to Boston, this time to represent
Ubuntu Linux at this year's Linux World Expo.Ã‚Â  The event, held in
Boston this week, will mark the first time Ubuntu Linux showcases their
product and also my "premier" as an active member of an Open Source
organization.Ã‚Â  I'll be hanging out among the hackers I read about
every day online and to be quite frank, it is very intimidating...Ã‚Â 
Hopefully I'll be able to represent what Ubuntu Linux is all about and
still manage to have fun!

I'm bringing with me 600 Breezy CDs and approximately 100 FREE passes
for the expo, so...Ã‚Â  If you need a pass, give me a call (646)
707-7723 and I'll hook you up.

Check back for some pictures here!
