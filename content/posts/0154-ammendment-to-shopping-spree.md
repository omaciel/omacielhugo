I forgot to add 2 other items purchased during said shopping spree:

[The Shins - Chutes Too
Narrow](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009LVXT/qid=1124912142/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-6992364-1119147?v=glance&s=music&n=507846):
I wanted to buy their album ever since I heard 2 of their songs in the
soundtrack CD for "Garden State". Good listening!

[Bluegrass
Today](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009P1PM/qid=1124912409/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-6992364-1119147?v=glance&s=music):
I confess... I'm addicted to bluegrass music!!! There, you're happy???
