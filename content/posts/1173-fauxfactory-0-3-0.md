title: FauxFactory 0.3.0
---

Took some time from my vacation and released **FauxFactory 0.3.0** to
make it **Python 3** compatible and to add a new **generate_utf8**
method (plus some nice tweaks and code clean up).

As always, the package is available on
[Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fauxfactory/) and can be installed
via **pip install fauxfactory**.

If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug report
or feature request, please use the
[Github](https://github.com/omaciel/fauxfactory) page.
