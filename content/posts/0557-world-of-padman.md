I was reading Digg this morning when I came across a post talking about
the [8 best games for
Linux](http://rangit.com/software/top-8-linux-games-of-2007/). I was
immediately attracted to a picture of the game [World of
Padman](http://www.worldofpadman.com/), which at first glance seemed to
be a game for children, but don't let it fool you.

The first thing I did was watch this
[video](http://padworld.myexp.de/index.php?news&update_id=55). That is
when I noticed that it looked a lot like a cartoon-ish version of Quake,
but with funny characters. The "weapons" are not as violent as those in
Quake, but even after I saw the weapon that uses water ballons for
amunition, I'm still not sure if I want to let my daughter Yv play it
yet.

Well, I downloaded the \~500Â MB Linux installer (there's also installers
for Windows and Mac) and had it running in only a few minutes.

This is a very fun game and it gives you the impression you're inside a
cartoon. Though I only managed to play it for 10 minutes since I had
promissed to take my daughter to the library (am writing this thanks to
their free access point), I can tell you this game has the potential to
be a very addict game. You may want to consider whether you want your
child to play it though.
