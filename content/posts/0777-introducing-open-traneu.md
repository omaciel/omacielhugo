title: Introducing Open-Tran.eu
---

Everyone who works with the translation of free and open source software
must know the web site [Open-Tran.eu](http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/) (if
you don't, I highly recommend it!), a translation repository online.

To quote [Jacek](http://sliwerski.net/), the brain behind the project:

> Proprietary software vendors may (if they can afford it) use CAT or TM
> software in order to ensure the consistency of their applications'
> terminology. Unfortunately, there are many different software vendors
> who are not willing to share their knowledge (which includes
> translation memory databases) with the others. And this is where the
> open source software could prove to be better than the proprietary. It
> could, but is not. Although everybody has full access to the
> translations of many open source programs, this opportunity is hardly
> ever used. The knowledge of hundreds (if not thousands) of people
> translating applications into their native languages is not
> centralized and thus hardly available to the others. This is the
> reason why the translations of even the most popular programs are not
> consistent with each other, which discourages people from using them.
> I'd like the Open-Tran.eu service to fill this gap and to provide the
> translators with a useful tool, which may improve the quality of their
> translations and increase the consistency of terminology in the open
> source software.Â·

One cool thing about this service is that you can observe problems with
the standardization of terms within a project, where certain
applications may have a term translated one way, and completely
different on other applications. Want to see a nice example? Type the
word "plugin" in the search field or clique this
[link](http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/suggest/plugin), to see the
discrepancies of how it was translated across several projects.

Want to see something even cooler? You could write a fairly simple
application to access this gold mine, and fetch the information you need
via the **XML-RPC** interface, a nice touch to the mix! Check out the
provided python script!

Today Jacek informed me that Open-Trans.eu has included the translations
for the [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org) project, augmenting the repository
and definitely making my life a whole lot easiet when analysing the
Brazilian Portuguese translations for the project.
