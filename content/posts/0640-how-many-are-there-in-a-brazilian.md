title: How many are there in a Brazilian?
---

For the [second](http://l10n.gnome.org/languages/pt_BR) release cycle in
a row, I'm pleased to announce that GNOME will be **100%**\* available
in **Brazilian Portuguese**! This feat shows again how the collaborative
effort between the Ubuntu and GNOME Brazilian translation teams! Since
all translations were submitted and aproved by the GNOME commiters
(thank you **Leonardo**, **Raphel** and **Jonh**!) first, every
GNU/Linux distribution will be able to take advantage of effort! If this
doesn't represent the true meaning of cooperation and collaborative
work, I don't know what else does!

I hope to also announce fairly soon that [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/)
will also be 100% translated into Brazilian Portuguese
([Openbox](http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page) already is),
yet another collaborative effort which I'm proud to have initiated.
