title: BillReminder Update
---

Due to the proximity to the release date for Dapper Drake, Ubuntu
Linux's latest version scheduled to be released this June first, I have
completely stopped working on my pet project,
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.sourceforge.net/). The translation
effort to bring Open Source goodness to the Brazilian masses has a
higher priority in my agenda, but the coding itch is still there!

BillReminder is completely written in C\#/Mono and makes use of the
newly incorporated Windows.Forms namespace for all its UI needs. The new
version of Mono and MonoDevelop should offer a great deal of new
functionality and an improved WinForms support!

Being that this is my first time working on an Open Source project, I
feel the need for some guidance and support to get it off the ground.
Anyone interested in lending me a hand, specially in adding a Gtk\# UI
to it, is encouraged to contact me via email or this post. All inquiries
will be replied to!
