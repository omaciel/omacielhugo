title: Life Is a Gift
---

I just had to share this with everyone. Have a great weekend!

> **Life Is a Gift** Today before you say an unkind word - Think of
> someone who can't speak. Before you complain about the taste of your
> food - Think of someone who has nothing to eat. Before you complain
> about your husband or wife - Think of someone who's crying out to GOD
> for a companion. Today before you complain about life - Think of
> someone who died too early on this earth. Before you complain about
> your children - Think of someone who desires children but they're
> barren. Before you argue about your dirty house someone didn't clean
> or sweep - Think of the people who are living in the streets. Before
> whining about the distance you drive Think of someone who walks the
> same distance with their feet. And when you are tired and complain
> about your job - Think of the unemployed, the disabled, and those who
> wish they had your job. But before you think of pointing the finger or
> condemning another - Remember that not one of us is without sin. And
> when depressing thoughts seem to get you down - Put a smile on your
> face and think: you're alive and still around.
