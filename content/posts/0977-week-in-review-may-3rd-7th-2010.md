1.  [Whatâ€™s new with Radio Tray?](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1016)
    -   <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1016>[Radio
        Tray](http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/), your favorite light
        weight online radio streaming application, has gone under some
        more development churn since its last release. Namely, there is
        now aÂ **dbus interface** to allow other applications to
        interact with it!
2.  [When the movie is better than the
    book](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1020)
    -   Over this past weekend I found just enough time to finish
        readingÂ [Band of
        Brothers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074322454X/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=18XEXBP3ARWNNFEEPQQV&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846)
        byÂ **Stephen E. Ambrose**, a book about the story of the men
        ofÂ **E Company**, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, U.S. Army
        infantry.
3.  [The Road to GUADEC 2010](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1026)
    -   This past April 16th I had the pleasure of receiving the
        following email:

        > Congratulations, your submissionÂ **Making easier for
        > companies to give back to GNOME** has been accepted for
        > presentation at GUADEC which is being held from 2010-07-26 to
        > 2010-07-30 at Den Haag.

        I was ecstatic!!! Having had the opportunity to attendÂ **GUADEC
        2009** atÂ **Las Palmas**,**Gran Canary** last year,Â  I was
        thrilled \[...\]
4.  [Can a plugin help you improve your writing
    skills?](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1030)
    -   My good friendÂ [Vinny](http://awkward-silence.com/) introduced
        me toÂ [After the Deadline](http://afterthedeadline.com/),
        aÂ niftyÂ **WordPress** and**Firefox** plugin that promises to
        â€œï»¿help you write better by adding spell, style, and grammar
        checking to web applications.â€?
