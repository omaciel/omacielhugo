title: Splitting WordPress Export File with ChoppedPress

[![Four Views of a Book Press by

You're all probably tired of hearing me talking about my script to split
the XML-like file that **WordPress** generates when you use the
**Export** feature. Tonight I have finally added the final touches to it
and can now share it here with you.

If you don't remember, I wrote it because my good friend **Evandro**
from [QuartoEstudio.com](http://www.quartoestudio.com/en/) is always
getting asked by some of his clients to migrate an existing web blog to
a new host/domain and hands him a tarball containing the exported
content of a **WordPress** blog in **XML** format. The problem resides
on the issue that some web hosting providers will limit how big a file
can be uploaded via a POST method, and depending on how big this XML
file is, you may have to manually break it into smaller files first.

Along the way I learned a bit more about
[OptParse](http://bit.ly/amtEtM), [LXML](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) and
[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), so the
entire experience was very productive and fun. In the end, I solved my
issue by simple using the **\*strip_cdata=False**\* argument to the
**XMLParser** class. Got to love when the solution is that simple!

So, without further ado, I present you
**ChoppedPress**([download](https://bitbucket.org/omaciel/playground/raw/2e2a4cef1bac/choppedpress))!
In the next few days (or weeks, depending on what my schedule looks
like) I will make it more robust and add more error handling, etc. In
the meantime, I hope you will find it useful.

The usage should be pretty straight forward too:

``` {.python}
$ python choppedpress
Usage:  choppedpress  <INFILE> [[<OUTFILE>] [<TAG>] [<NUMBER>]]

ChoppedPress lets you split the WordPress XML export file into smaller files
that can be used to import your posts, comments, tags and categories into a
new WordPress installation.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i , --infile=
                        The XML file generated by WordPress
  -o , --outfile=
                        The name for the smaller XML files. [default: out]
  -t TAG, --tag=TAG     The XML tag that represents your data. [default:
                        /rss/channel/item]
  -n NUMBER, --number=NUMBER
                        How many new files should be generated. [default: 2]
