The third and last day at the exposition was without a doubt the best
day of them all! There were times when I was completely surrounded by
people who just wanted to chit-chat... but there were many chances to
just walk around, talk to people, take a few extra pictures and not
worry about leaving my helper alone in the booth.Ã‚Â  Some of the
highlights in my oppinion were:

-   The guys from [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) were playing XBox 360
    all day long using the huge screen they had set up at their lounge
    area;

-   They also brought in a freezer filled to the top with ice cream,
    which quickly vanished as they started distributing it together with
    other things such as t-shirts;
-   I got to meet Komander Taco, the "brain"behind Slashdot;

-   I got to meet Jon Ã¢â‚¬Å"Mad DogÃ¢â‚¬Â? Hall;
-   I got to meet [Mitch
    Pirtle](http://dev.joomla.org/component/option,com_jd-wp/Itemid,33/p,83/),
    one of the core developers for [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) and
    convinced him to be a guest speaker at the MySQL User Group I go to
    in the near future.Ã‚Â  Without a doubt, a great guy!

-   Got to meet [Ivan KrstiÃ„â€¡](https://launchpad.net/people/krstic),
    one of the co-authors for the upcoming book Ã¢â‚¬Å"[The Official
    Ubuntu
    Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132435942/sr=8-2/qid=1144586788/ref=pd_bbs_2/102-5290391-8745702?%5Fencoding=UTF8).Ã¢â‚¬Â?
    He approached our booth and pretended to be a new Linux user, asking
    me: Ã¢â‚¬Å"Why should I use Ubuntu Linux?Ã¢â‚¬Â? and Ã¢â‚¬Å"How is
    the server version?Ã¢â‚¬Â? I gave him the best answer I could come
    up with at the moment, telling him that he should use which ever
    distribution better served his needs, even if that meant using
    something else besides Ubuntu.Ã‚Â  In the end he told me his true
    identity and told me I had actually given a very good answer;
-   I met and convinced Jack, one of the developers from the
    [Fedora](http://fedora.redhat.com/) project to also be a guest
    speaker;

-   Someone visiting from New Jersey brought me his PowerPC so I could
    take a look and help him figure out why his wireless card wouldn't
    work.Ã‚Â  After playing with it for a bit I noticed that I couldn't
    get an IP address assigned to his card.Ã‚Â  Luckly, Joseph, the lead
    PowerPC developer for Gentoo Linux was around and was more than
    happy to lend us a hand.Ã‚Â  After performing a real
    Ã¢â‚¬Å"operationÃ¢â‚¬Â? on the powerbook, we realized that the
    problem was due to an older version of the firware.Ã‚Â  We promptly
    walked to the Mac guys who were also at the expo and after doing
    some pretty neat booting tricks via the firewire ports, we were able
    to upgrade the firmaware and get the PowerPC to connect to the local
    access point!

-   Another pretty neat thing that took place at the expo was when near
    the closing time, the O'Reilly guys simply decided to give all of
    the books they hand on display (a couple of thousands in my rough
    estimate) away!Ã‚Â  Amazing!!!Ã‚Â  I walked out of the exposition
    floor with a **whole box** of great books!Ã‚Â  I intend to share the
    loot with people from the user groups I go to...

Overall, I got to meet a great deal of interesting people and I just
couldn't mention all of the events that took place over those 3
days!Ã‚Â  I ended up spending approximately \$900 out of my pocket for
the priviledge of representing something I trully believe in!Ã‚Â  Add
the fact that I will not get paid for this week and you can imagine the
financial blow I have taken...Ã‚Â  But no money could have bought the
experience and sheer pleasure to talk to several hundred users who
wouldn't stop bragging how much they liked our distro!

Just like the Visa adds on [TV:Ã‚Â](TV:Ã‚Â)  PRICELESS!
