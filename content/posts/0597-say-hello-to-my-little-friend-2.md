Say hello to my little friend **NTrunko,** my Nokia N800 tablet! It
arrived yesterday at my housee, thanks to a good friend and the good
folks at Nokia and Maemo!

I've spent a good chunk of last night playing with it and am COMPLETELY
amazed with the quality and potential it has to offer! This post, for
instance, is being written using [Maemo
WordPy](http://maemo-wordpy.garage.maemo.org/).

I even connected home via ssh! :)
