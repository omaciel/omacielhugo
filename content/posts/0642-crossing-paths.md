It was interesting to see an
[article](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2198483/ubuntu-expands-virtual)
mentioning [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) and
[rPath](http://www.rpath.com/corp) (where I work) in the same paragraph,
since Ubuntu was responsible for my entrance into the open source world,
and rPath is responsible for allowing me to work (i.e. get paid) with
it!

Being the pioneers of the whole Linux appliances business, I was
surprised that not much information was provided on what we (rPath) do,
not even a link to the company's web site.
