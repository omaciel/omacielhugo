title: Learn to use the GIMP in 10 easy FREE videos
---

**Shameless plug ahead**:

If you speak Portuguese and want to learn how to use the GIMP like the
pros, I strongly recommend you check out my good friend **AntÃƒÂ´nio
"LedStyle" ClÃƒÂ¡udio**\'s new
[project](http://www.tuxresources.org/blog/?p=183)! "LedStyle" and I
have worked together before doing podcasts for the Brazilian Ubuntu
Planet, and my respect and admiration for him has never stopped
growing!Ã‚Â  I downloaded the first video (out of 10, plus all the
exercise material freely available) and was very impressed by his
didactic skills!
