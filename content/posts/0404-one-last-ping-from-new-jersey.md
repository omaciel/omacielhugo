title: One last ping from New Jersey
---

The apartment is completely "packed" and what for the last 2 years had
been my home has been reduced to a monotonous pile of small boxes.Ã‚Â 
My internet is also down and I'm only able to post this last post due to
a generous neighbor and his open wireless access.Ã‚Â  Tomorrow I'm
loading the truck and will drive down to my new place early Friday
morning.Ã‚Â  I confess I feel a bit emotional about leaving behind the
friends, places, and things that shaped my life for the last 16
years...Ã‚Â  But the future looks very promising and I can't wait for
the day (which I'm sure will come very soon) I can finally go back to
enjoying life and all the good things it has to offer us!

So long Garden State...
