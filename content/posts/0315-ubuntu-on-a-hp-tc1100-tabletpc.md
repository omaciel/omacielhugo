title: Ubuntu on a HP TC1100 TabletPC
---

Today I managed to get some free time from work (I had to run this
process that usually takes 55 minutes to complete) and decided to pop
the CD for the new version of Ubuntu Linux, codenamed Dapper Drake, into
a friend's TabletPC (HP model TC1100).

I honestly didn't really know what to expect but was gladly surprised to
see the welcoming site of Gnome's splash screen, followed by the
soothing startup sound.Ã‚Â  Though I didn't have much time to "play"
with it, everything was apparently working fine... well, except for the
stylus.Ã‚Â  I also didn't get a chance to test the wireless card.

The whole experience left me salivating for more and I'm definitely
looking forward to the weekend, when I plan on doing some more tweaking
while watching the World Cup of Soccer (GO BRAZIL!!!). :)
