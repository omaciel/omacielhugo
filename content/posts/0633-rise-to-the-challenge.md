title: Rise to the challenge!
---

For anyone who has read my previous
[post](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=392) and know me... or know and read
my blog, I'd like to ask for a personal favor. Every day I see people
taking the time to submit news bits to sites like **Digg**,
**Slashdot**, etc, about several different topics, varying from how to
do stuff on your computer to the daily Hollywood gossip. What I ask is
the following:

Write something, no matter how big or small, about what I wrote on my
previous post about this
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-O2iIHXyn0). Submit to Digg,
Slashdot, and any other news site out there! Ask your friends to blog
about it! Raise hell!

I sincerely apologize for those who are used to reading usually tech
news from my blog and kindly ask for your comprehension...

**UPDATE:** There's an English version of the video! Thanks **Claudio**
and **Sulamita**!
