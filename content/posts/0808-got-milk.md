One of my favorite web services ever
([Open-Tran.eu](http://open-tran.blogspot.com)) announced today what I
consider to be the **best feature of 2008**! **PERIOD**! What am I
talking about? I'm talking about the possibilty of viewing the
comparison of how a single string was translated across several
projects! You have to experience it to understand how great this is! To
quote **Jacek Åšliwerski**, the brain behind this:

> I added new functionality to the service. Now you can compare the
> translations of phrases between the projects. Right now, the only way
> to see the comparison table is to enter an appropriate URL (or use the
> [API](http://open-tran.eu/RPC2)). Here is an example URL:
>
> -   [http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/compare/zoom
>     in](http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/compare/zoom%20in)
>
> If you follow it, you will see the table with suggestions grouped by
> the projects, so that you can see the differences between their
> translations.

If this doesn't give you a fuzzy feeling (pun intended), I don't know
what will!
