On a previous post I had promised to comment on the movie
[Sideways](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/). I finally managed to
see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very pleased
with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the
dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. **Paul
Giamatti** (Miles) and **Thomas Haden Church** (Jack) take you on a
roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in
life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous
adventures. I won't get into what the plot of the movie is (you can
check it out by clicking on the link above) but I will garantee you will
not be disappointed! It is yet another great example that a movie
doesn't have to show tasteless nudity or have a star-filled cast or be
completely rendered with special effects in order to be good. Since wine
tasting plays a major role in the movie, one can't help but long for a
tall glass of red wine by the time it's over (but **NO MERLOT**!!!) :)
