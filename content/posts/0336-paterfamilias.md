This is very off topic but I couldn't resit.Ã‚Â  My wife and I have been
blessed for the second time, and are officially expecting out second
child!Ã‚Â  We received confirmation yesterday from my wife's doctor that
she is in her very forst week of pregancy!Ã‚Â  Little Yv (my daughter)
is extremelly exicted about the prospect of having a little baby to play
with.Ã‚Â  In fact, her reaction was the best thing it could have
happened to us!
