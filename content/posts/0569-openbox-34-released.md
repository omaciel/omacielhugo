title: Openbox 3.4 Released!
---

It is finally here!!! **Openbox 3.4** was just released, together with a
fresh version of **ObConf 2.0**!!! I believe this is the first time I've
avidly followed the development and release of an application, and I'm
very proud of the work the entire **Openbox Crew** has put together!
Read the official announcement
[here](http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Openbox:News#Openbox_3.4).
