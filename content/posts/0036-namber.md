Interesting:

> A [namber](http://mysteryrobot.com/) is part name and part number.
> Each number between 0 and 255 has a namber. For example, 1 is fun and
> 213 is star. A namber address is an internet address that uses
> nambers. For example, mysteryrobot.com's namber is
> drum.start.orange.hope.mysteryrobot.com.
