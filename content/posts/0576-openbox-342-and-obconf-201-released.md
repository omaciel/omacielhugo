title: Openbox 3.4.2 and ObConf 2.0.1 released
---

As the title says, **Openbox 3.4.2** and **ObConf 2.0.1** were just
released. Due to some confusion from some people I've talked to, this
new version is not yet available for Ubuntu or Debian via the
repositories (i.e. apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic).

For those running **Ubuntu Feisty** or **Debian Etch**, download the
.deb files from the downloads
[page](http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Openbox:Download). You'll
also find packages for **Slackware** and **Arch Linux**. If you are
however running **Foresight Linux**:

> sudo conary update openbox obconf

I spent some time today creating a new **Openbox** theme for my system
(pictured above). If you're interested in trying it out, you can get it
[here](http://www.box-look.org/content/show.php/Foresight+Green?content=60176).

Remember how I mentioned I had a sore throat on my birthday? Well, it
got worse and it became a full blown allergy/flu/mutant bug. Spent the
weeked taking antibiotics and anti-inflamatory medicine... I'm feeling
better but the problem (sinus infection) is still lingering.
