title: "Writing a Book: Check!"

Growing up my dad used to tell me that there are three important milestones on a manâ€™s life (though I feel that the same could be said about any gender):

* Plant a tree
* Have a child
* Write a book

Through my life, I have planted quite a few trees, including a lemon and papaya tree I used to treat as my imaginary friends :)

I have also had the highest honor to be the father to three amazing girls!

This last March I was able to check the last item on that list off, by writing and self-publishing a book about my personal history around what I do for a living.

Today, I finally got a chance to hold in my own hands a physical copy of this book, and while I cannot compare this experience to what I felt when holding each one of my daughters, the feeling is nevertheless breathtaking.
