It's official!!! I have arranged for [Benjamin Mako
Hill](http://mako.yukidoke.org/), Debian and Ubuntu Linux package
maintaner/contributer, to attend our next [Northern New Jersey
Meetup](http://linux.meetup.com/8/) meeting this Monday 11th, 2005! I
have asked him to talk about [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org) Linux
and also his involvement with [Debian](http://www.debian.org). This
should be a very interesting meeting for everyone and I urge everyone to
show up! Make sure to [reserve](http://linux.meetup.com/8/) your spot so
I have a good idea of how many people will be present. Right now I am
thinking of meeting at the front of the store (Panera Bread, Route 4
West Paramus, NJ @ 7pm) where there are some couches and lots of plugs!
If the number of people reserving increases, I'll try to reserve the
conference room!
