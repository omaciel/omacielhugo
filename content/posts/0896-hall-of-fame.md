Just nominated who I think should be "inducted" into the Ubuntu [Hall of
Fame](http://hall-of-fame.ubuntu.com):Â  [AndrÃ©
Gondim](https://launchpad.net/~andregondim) from the Ubuntu Brazilian
translations team!

Andre started contributing with translations quite some time ago, but
for whatever reason stopped contributing for a while. One day,
completely out of the blue, he approached me and asked me to lend him a
hand to get started again... fast forward a few years later, and Andre
is without a doubt the most active and interested translator for the
entire Ubuntu Brazilian team! From a timid pupil he's become someone who
can inspire and a role model for anyone who wants to contribute with the
translation of open source software. After "suffering" my pestering for
so long, he is also very active with the translation of upstream GNOME
and maybe, with some more pestering, he may join other projects as well.
