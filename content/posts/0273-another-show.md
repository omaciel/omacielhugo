This April 22-23 I will be once again "on the road" to represent Ubuntu
Linux at this year's [Trenton Computer
Festival](http://www.tcf-nj.org/ps).Ã‚Â  Having just got
[back](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=244) from Linux World Expo in Boston,
this shouldn't be too intimidating for me.Ã‚Â  I must confess, it was
pretty intimidating to face literally hundreds of people and provide
them with satisfactory answers.Ã‚Â  I feel a bit more "seasoned" now and
should be able to feel more confortable now.

Anyhow, any Ubunteiros out there in the Tri-State area interested in
lending me a hand?Ã‚Â  I also need some extra CDs to give out since I
pretty much ran out of the 600 CDs I had ordered for LWE in less than 2
hours!!!
