My good friend SuperToadman pointed me to this online [Myer-Briggs Test
For Programmers](http://eggheadcafe.com/articles/mb/default.asp) today
and I was amazed at how accurate the results came out!!! The test came
very, very close to describe how I see myself. Come to think of it, I
can see how this shaped my decisions in life.

Anyhow, here's some more background on ENFP "personalities"... Anyone
who knows me personally agree/disagree with it?
