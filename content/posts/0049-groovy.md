Today I actually enjoyed work!!! Do you have any idea how hard it is for
me to mention "work" and "enjoy" together? I haven't done it since early
2002 when I worked for the now defunct **Synaptic Pharmaceuticals**!!! I
spent most of the day working on a new VB.NET application for work
(something very small and simple for XML generation) and my C\# (soon to
become [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page)) rss reader. It
feels absolutely great to be back in the groove of coding! I only wish
everyday could be like this... Hope this will last for a while...
