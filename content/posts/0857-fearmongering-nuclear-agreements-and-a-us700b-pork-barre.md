title: Fearmongering, Nuclear agreements and a US\$700B pork barrel
---

With last night's VP debate still fresh in my memory and the entire
"rescue plan" that is about to rape us all, I went through all the
comments that people have added to my latest posts and wanted to make a
few comments.

First off, I was one of those who up until 5 years ago wanted nothing to
do with politics... not only that, I was also happy with being a green
card holder and saw no advantages in becoming a citizen. Let me just
make something clear: I've lived here in the United States of America
for way too long and have always considered it to be my adopted home!
Even though I did not have a piece of paper that stated that I was a
citizen, I have always felt like one as I have always been a law abiding
citizen and care about the future of our nation. The "problem" was more
of an annoyance, for my experience dealing with immigration offices had
been less than stellar... at least that is how it was back when I lived
in Northern New Jersey, where you were pretty much treated like a
criminal the moment you got within a certain range from an Immigration,
err... Department of Home Land Security office, but that is not the
subject of this post.

The thing is that about 5 years ago I got fed up of the entire Bush
doctrine and how passive our entire legislative branch had been...
correction, **has been** all of these years! When the last presidential
election came around and I found myself waiting for my (citizenship)
paper work to be processed, I helplessly watched from the sidelines as
Bush was re-elected. This year this will not happen again!

Anyhow, the "rescue plan" goes back to the House for a second round
tonight and I'm not sure what to expect this time. I did let my
congressman know how I feel about it but based on what I read he is in
favor of this bill... Will he vote based on what people tell him or
based on his private agenda, I don't know. All I know is that I'm
exercising my rights this year, something I have never done before! I
also invite everyone who is a citizen of the Unites States of America to
exercise their rights and [let your
congressperson](http://www.house.gov/) know how you feel about this and
every other issue!

One thing that was very interesting during the debate was the question
about enabling other nations to obtain nuclear technologies. I will not
get into all the nitty gritty things said yesterday, but I thought it
was interesting that the same day the senate approved the bail out bill,
they also approved another bill which will allow India, the "second
largest democracy in the world" (not my words... just paraphrasing the
bill) to obtain nuclear technology from us! Interesting...

[Also](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95279780),
it was rather entertaining to
[watch](http://br.youtube.com/watch?v=-i0su1roQLI) senator McCain
talking about the need to **veto** the bill he had just **voted in favor
the night before**!

Lastly, interesting [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaG9d_4zij8)
of Rep. Brad Sherman about more fearmongering tactics being used to get
things done!
