title: Calling All Constructors
---

I wanted to change some code I had written last week so that an
::google("overloaded constructor", "overloaded constructor"):: would
call the default constructor. This is usefull when you have to perform
an initialization to a class member no matter what constructor is called
during the class' initialization. I faintly remembered Java's Base and
SuperBase(?) syntax and tried several combinations of **this** and
**base** keywords. Nothing seemed to work... That's when I came across
[this](http://weblogs.asp.net/acampbell/archive/2005/02/02/365299.aspx)
post which gave me the answer:

`public class PostList     {`

    private ArrayList m_Posts;

    #region Constructor

    public PostList()
    {
        m_Posts = new ArrayList();
    }

    public PostList(XmlNode posts): this()
    {
        PopulatePosts(posts);
    }

    #endregion

}
