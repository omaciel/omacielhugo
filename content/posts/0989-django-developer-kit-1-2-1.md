I have just released the [Django Developer Kit
1.2.1](http://www.rpath.org/web/project/djangodevkit) appliance to match
with the release of [Django](http://djangoproject.com) **1.2.1**! Check
this [page](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/may/24/121/) for
more information about this release!

There are several ways for you to play with the Django Developer Kit
appliance, so just head on down to the
[download](http://bit.ly/DjangoDevKit121) page and pick from the
following image types:

-   x86 Amazon Machine Image (EC2)
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 0.9
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 1.0
-   x86 VMware (R) Virtual Appliance
-   x86 Appliance Installable ISO
-   x86 Mountable Filesystem: Raw Filesystem Image
-   x86_64 Amazon Machine Image (EC2)
-   x86_64 Mountable Filesystem: Raw Filesystem Image
-   x86_64 Appliance Installable ISO
-   x86_64 VMware (R) Virtual Appliance
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 0.9
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 1.0

Once you've installed it (or launched it if using the **ESX**, **OVF**
or **Amazon Machine Image**), point your browser to the appliance's IP
address plus port 8003 (i.e. xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8003, but this information
will be displayed in the console too), login as **admin** with the
default password of **password** and finish the wizard. You can then use
the **root password plugin** to set the password of the root user to ssh
into the box and start hacking.
