title: BarCamp Raleigh 2008

This weekend I'll be attending [BarCamp
Raleigh](http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU) for the second year in a row.
Together with a couple of fellow [rPathians](http://www.rpath.org), I'm
planning to pitch in the following talks:

-   Building GNU/Linux appliances and deploying them in the clouds
-   How to participate and contribute with open source projects like
    GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Openbox, etc

If you're one of the lucky ones who managed to register in time for the
event, tomorrow there will be a get together (think drinks, snacks and
all the trilug geeks you can fit in a bar) at [Tyler's Tap
Room](http://www.tylerstaproom.com/durham/)
([map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=324+BLACKWELL+ST,+SUITE+400,+DURHAM+NC+27701%28Tyler%27s+Taproom+Durham%29&hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16)).
