title: The 2 people you meet in Heaven
---

Hipothetically speaking, if I were giving the opportunity to travel back
in time and meet 2 people, anyone, from the past, I wouldn't hesitate to
say:

1.  Jesus
2.  Leonardo Da Vinci

in that order.Ã‚Â  Can you imagine what it would be like to be able to
"pick their brains"???Ã‚Â  What about you?
