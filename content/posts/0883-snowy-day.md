Today we had snow in **Chapel Hill** for the first time since I moved
from Northern New Jersey. I not a big fan of the white stuff since it
used to mean cleaning up the car, drive to the slush, and get all wet.
But my girls loved it, specially **Yv** who seized the opportunity to
make snow angels.

It was also **Kate**\'s first snow and eventhough she\'s been coffing
lately, we decided to bring her outside (wearing a heavy coat) to play
for a while.

I now await for the snow to stop so I clean the car for tomorrow, though
the forecast is for a warmer day which should get rid of all the snow.
