In the attempt to attract more people to the organized effort of
translating a large number of Open Source applications from English to
other languages, here's a small HOWTO. Hope to be able to inspire more
people to join in.

First, register (FREE) yourself here:
[LaunchPad](https://launchpad.net/), "a collection of services for
projects in the open source universe. You can register your project, and
then collaborate with the open source community on translations, bug
tracking and code."

Then, take a look at the available languages (I'll be using the
Brazilian Portuguese language since I speak it fluently):
<https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/breezy/+translations>

Now (finally), choose a program that needs to be translated from the
huge list. Being that you are not an official member of the \$LANGUAGE
Team, you can only make suggestions (by typing in your suggestion
underneath the phrase in english and clicking the save button at the
bottom of the page) for the time being. Someone from the team should
then review it and approve it (or not). If you want to be part of the
team, and therefore be able to apply your translations right away,
contact the team leader by emailing him at the provided email address.

That's all there is to it! Very simple, don't you think?
