title: Going To The Country
---

The day I fly to North Carolina has finally arrived. I'm **extremelly**
excited about this trip for it could be the kick in ass I need to get
back on track with my goals. I'll be staying at my younger sister's
apartment which I believe is near the [UNC](http://www.unc.edu)\'s
Chapel Hill campus. She\'s already scheduled 4 interviews with the
chairs of 4 different departments and I have just emailed her to try to
get me 2 more. I can already feel my brain itching with all the ideas
that are coming up to the surface after having spent almost 8 years in
the back burner. I guess the itch turned into a major rash the day I
drove past the MIT campus while visiting
[Vinny](http://blog.supertoadman.com) 2 weeks ago. I joked that if you
could tune in your brain to listen to the "brain waves" being
transmitted near the campus you'd see how much information was being
generated. More than ever I'm convinced that I belong in the academic
and research worlds and am wasting away working as a "mercenary coder."
I have this gut feeling that this trip could be the one that will change
my life for the best!
