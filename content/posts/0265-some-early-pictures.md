Didn't get around to take a lot of pictures due to the craziness from
yesterday.Ã‚Â  Here are a couple I managed to take early on...

The other guy who's supposed to lend me a hand hasn't shown up yet and
could be lost somewhere between NY and MA...Ã‚Â  This could turn out to
be a reaaaally long day for me...
