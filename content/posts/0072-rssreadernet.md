Been spending some time using the [RSS.NET](http://www.rssdotnet.com/)
library (*\"RSS.NET is an open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds.
It provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds.
It is fully compatible with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1,
implementing all constructs.\"* and decided to create my own Rss reader.
It still has a long way to go but it is in a semi-usefull state. I know
there's a million rss readers out there but if anyone is interested in
working on this with me just drop me a line.
