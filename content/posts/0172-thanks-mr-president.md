title: Thanks Mr. President

Thanks to our President visiting NYC for that U.N. meeting "thing," it
only took me **one extra hour** to make it to work! Since our company's
policy doesn't allow us to "make up" for lost time by staying late or
coming in earlier, his visit just cost me 1 hour off my salary!
