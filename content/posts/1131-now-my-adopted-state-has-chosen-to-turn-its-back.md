title: Now My Adopted State Has Chosen To Turn Its Back
---

Now my adopted state has chosen to turn its back on its tradition of
welcoming immigrants, and of tolerance and freedom to all its citizens,
with a proposed amendment to the NC State Constitution no less, that
hangs a great banner across the entrances to the state saying to a whole
bunch of American citizens: You are not welcome here.
