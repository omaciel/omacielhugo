title: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About The Creative Commons
  Licenses But Was Afraid To Ask
---

A while back my friend **Karlisson Bezerra**, author of the
**Brazilian** **comic** (all using open source tools such as
**Inkscape**, etc)Â [Nerdson](http://nerdson.com/blog/), created a pretty
nifty story explaining how to use the [Creative
Commons](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Creative_Commons)
license. The [original strip](http://nerdson.com/blog/criativos-comuns/)
was written in Brazilian Portuguese but someone took the time to do a
quick translation into English (as the translator is not a native
Brazilian Portuguese speaker, some things got lost in the translation,
but the end result is still worth checking). So here is the finished
work, enjoy it!
