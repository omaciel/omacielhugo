Today I'm releasing my ï»¿[Django Developer Kit Appliance
1.2.2](http://bit.ly/byzBLV) due to the recent [security
release](http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2010/sep/08/security-release/)
of **Django 1.2.2**. Other than a newer version of Django, you'll also
get newer versions of several packages already included by default in
the appliance.

I have been working hard (time permitting, off course) on migrating the
appliance to a slim [Foresight Linux](http://www.foresightlinux.org)
base in order to upgrade the underlying python **from 2.4 to latest
2.6.x**, plus other goodies such as a newer kernel and the very latest
versions of your favorite versioning control systems! This will also
mean that I won't have to maintain several packages on different places
and will be able to leverage of the work being done on **Foresight**!

As always, choose from the following image types:

-   Amazon EC2 AMI Large (**ami-7a906513**)
-   Amazon EC2 AMI Small (**ami-7290651b**)

Remember that the appliance comes with its own management system that
can be accessed by pointing your browser to
**https://YOUR-APPLIANCE-IP:8003** and logging in as the **admin** user
(the default password the first time you boot your appliance is
**password**, but you will immediately be asked to change it during the
1-step setup wizard). From there you can also **configure backups**,
**updates**, and **manage system services**.

I hope you'll enjoy the appliance and next time I hope to be announcing
the **newer Foresight Linux platform**!
