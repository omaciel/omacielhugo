title: "Using Foresight Linux: Week 1"
---

Been using [Foresight Linux](http://foresightlinux.com/) at work for the
last 8 days and am pretty impressed with the stability and community so
far. Work hasn't let me get knee deep into the documentation and all the
nitty gritty details about the conary system, but I have a walking
reference sitting right next to me! :) I've been bugging him to develop
a "lite" version of it so I can get some of my friends with "limited
bandwith" to take it for a spin, and I can proudly claim that it is
working... hehehehe More information about that soon, right
[Ken](http://ken.vandine.org/)? *wink* *wink*

I'd just love to see [conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary) make
its way to Ubuntu... maybe once I know enough about it I can make strong
enough arguments to convince people to give it a whirl.

By the way, the weather rocks down here! ;)
