title: Customized Ubuntu Dapper Drake Live CD 1,2,3
---

This article was inspired by another article from my good friend [Alex
Rocha](http://alexrocha.wordpress.com/), who has just taken the plunge
into the blogging world, pointing out a document showing how one can
create their own customized Live CD with Ubuntu Dapper Drake.Ã‚Â  The
[document](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization/6%2e06)
is a detailed step by step which could help you create a Live CD with
all your favorite programas, including all the **multimedia codecs**,
**flash**, and **java** for a complete "out-of-the-box" experience,
specially if you're trying to convince your aunt or grandparents to
migrate from Windows 98.Ã‚Â

But in order to complete such feat, it is necessary to roll up your
sleves and get jiggy with the command line, which could be a bit "scary"
for those who haven't yet experience the true power that Linux has to
offer.Ã‚Â  That's when I came across a reference to a [graphical
nterface](http://lichota.net/%7Ekrzysiek/projects/ubuntu-livecd-customization/)
that pretty much does the same thing for you!Ã‚Â  I took a quick peek at
the instructions, shockfull of pictures, and I can say that now anyone
can create their own Live CD!Ã‚Â  I haven't tried it yet but would love
to hear from those who manage to give it a whirl before I get a chabce.
Enjoy it!
