title: What Does It Mean???
---

What does it mean when your direct supervisor keeps asking you to do
some of his tasks and you know for a fact there's no promotion involved?
I guess my biggest "beef" is the *type* of stuff he asks me to write
about:

-   What is .NET and what advantages does it offer?
-   What are the advantages of using Microsoft Visual Source Safe (VSS)?
-   What are the requirements for working on the code library we **just
    purchased** and have **no documentation** on???
-   What is ADO.NET and how can we use it?

This wouldn't bother me as much but I was told (by my recruiter) I was
joining a team of talented .NET developers when I took this job!!!
