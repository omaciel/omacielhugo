I'm really excited to announce the release of my [Django Developer
Kit](http://www.rpath.org/web/project/djangodevkit) 1.2 RC1! The
highlights for this release include the first **Release Candidate** for
the upcoming **Django 1.2**, as well as a switch of the underlying
platform, from **CentOS** to **rPath Linux 2**. All kinks have been
worked out and setting up a Django-based project in the appliance is a
piece of cake! Some of the Django modules included are:

-   django=r13117-1-1
-   django-ajax-selects=r24_patched-2-1
-   django-authopenid=0.9.6-1-1
-   django-authority0.4-1-1
-   django-cache-memcached=r13117-1-1

-   django-db-sqlite3=r13117-1-1
-   django-evolution=r165-1-1
-   django-favorites=b145949-1-1

There are several ways for you to play with the Django Developer Kit
appliance, so just head on down to the
[download](http://bit.ly/DjangoDevKitRC1) page and pick from the
following image types:

-   x86 Amazon Machine Image (EC2)
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 0.9
-   x86 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 1.0
-   x86 VMware (R) Virtual Appliance
-   x86 Appliance Installable ISO
-   x86 Mountable Filesystem: Raw Filesystem Image
-   x86_64 Amazon Machine Image (EC2)
-   x86_64 Mountable Filesystem: Raw Filesystem Image
-   x86_64 Appliance Installable ISO
-   x86_64 VMware (R) Virtual Appliance
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 0.9
-   x86_64 VMware (R) ESX Server Virtual Appliance OVF 1.0

Once you've installed it (or launched it if using the **ESX**, **OVF**
or **Amazon Machine Image**), point your browser to the appliance's IP
address plus port 8003 (i.e. xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8003, but this information
will be displayed in the console too), login as **admin** with the
default password of **password** and finish the wizard. You can then use
the **root password plugin** to set the password of the root user to ssh
into the box and start hacking.
