title: Good Debian Server Setup HOWTO
---

Earlier this year [OSNews](http://www.osnews.com) published my
[article](http://www.ogmaciel.com/?page_id=101) titled *\"Installing
Debian Linux For The Faint Of Heart.\"* Today I came across [another
article](http://www.harrysufehmi.com/phpwiki/index.php/SettingUpLinuxServer)
dealing with the same subject. Now, I know people have hammered these
types of articles to death in the net but this one sounded worth the
risk of mentioning. For one thing, it covers hardening your bare-bones
[Debian](http://www.debian.org) server which, IMHO should be worth
looking at no matter what.
