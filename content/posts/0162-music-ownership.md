While telling a co-worker how I managed to listen to my private \*.ogg
music files, I was asked if my music collection was "**legal**?" Having
never spent much attention or time trying to understand what the music
industry's peeve with music swappers, I started to think out loud what
the answer should be to his question. The logic I used was as follows:

> *All of my current music files were originally encoded from my own,
> store-bought CDs... I have pretty much gotten away with keeping the
> real CDs at home because \[lengthy explanation followed here\]... and
> decided to keep a digitized copy stored in one of my many external
> hard drives. Following the fact that I legally own my CDs, I can only
> assume that the answer to your question is:Yes, my current music
> collection ISlegal!!!*

Now, if I were to take one of my own store-bought CDs and gave it away
to a friend while still retaining my digitized copy, does that make me
violate any copyright law concerning to the music industry? Does it mean
that I never actually own the CD (for I cannot do as I please with it)?
