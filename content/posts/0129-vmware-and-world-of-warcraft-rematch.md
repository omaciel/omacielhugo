title: "VMWare and World of Warcraft: Rematch"
---

Here I am on my second attempt at installing World of Warcraft into my
virtual Windows XP computer (through VMWare) on a Gentoo Linux. So far I
have been able to bypass the first obstacle I had encountered on my
first attempt and things seem to be moving along... Will post future
developments later...

Update: The installation borked on CD 4 of install... Back to doing some
more research... WoW 2 x 1 Me.
