Through the years our relationship changed and as with a good wine (I
want to believe) it improved. Some of you became **really** good friends
to me and it was painful for me to watch you pack and leave. I can
assure you that you'll be missed\...

Hang in there and may your 2009 turn out to be the beginning of a great
and new adventure!
