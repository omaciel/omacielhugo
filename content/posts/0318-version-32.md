title: Version 3.2
---

Today I complete yet another life cycle, version 3.2! Some bugs have
been fixed and the "application" seems to be a bit more robust. New bugs
I'm sure will be discovered (and hopefully reported too), and even a
"fork" seems to be stabilizing in the shape of my (almost) 5-year-old
daughter! ;)

This last year marked my de facto entry into the open source world!
Together with other people, we founded [Planeta Ubuntu
Brasil](http://planeta.ubuntubrasil.org/), a blog aggregator completely
designed for brazilian portuguese speaking users, and helped place the
[Ubuntu Brasil](http://www.ubuntubrasil.org/) community on the map! I
was also named the administrator for the [Ubuntu Brazilian Portuguese
Translators](https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pt-br), a
"position" I am **extremelly** proud to maintain! I made many friends,
some just as passionate as me, but also got involved in a few
tribulations of my own due to some administrative decisions... but I am
certain that nobody can honestly doubt my enthusiasm, dedication, and
passion for the community. I have many plans and adventures planned for
this new life cycle, which hopefully I'll be able to relate any success
or failures this dreamer may come across!
