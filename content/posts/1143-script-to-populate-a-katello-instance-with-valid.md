title: Script to populate a Katello instance with valid data

Every now and then I need to populate a brand new
[Katello](http://www.katello.org) installation with some valid
organizations, users and products to test certain areas... and after a
while I developed a [script](https://gist.github.com/3166535) which I
find very handy that does just that and may be of use for someone else.
If you also find it useful, feel free to fork it and contribute with
your own tricks. :)
