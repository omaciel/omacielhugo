-   Built a MT-Daapd Linux appliance to share my music at home.
    Installed it in a machine with 1GB of RAM and am now as happy as I
    can be. The whole thing weighs in at 237MB (I've included vim,
    openssh, libogg plus a few other nuggets) and off course everything
    is managed by the awesome
    [conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary) technology. I've also
    added ushare (upnp support) and am hoping to make it so that sharing
    videos and music can be all done via a web interface. I haven't made
    the installable ISO or VMWare image available yet but will do it
    soon.
-   Speaking of other technologies, I've been playing with a MacBook
    these last 2 days and am generally happy with the experience.
    Everything just... works! What? No need to tweak configuration
    files? With the exception of the lack of a right-click button, so
    far I give it 2 thumbs up.
-   Since we're talking about operating systems, I was really glad to
    see that [Foresight](http://www.foresightlinux.org/) Linux has been
    awarded the [2008 Ovatio
    Award](http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/ars-awards-2008.ars/7)
    as the **Distribution of the Year**, and honor that is shared with
    its other green cousin, [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/). I have
    been running Foresight for over 2 years now and I just cannot
    imagine any other distribution that would give me the same
    flexibility, stability and coolness combo. You want to see a
    distribution that knows how to be a first citizen in the upstream
    world? Come talk to me on \#foresight on Freenode.
-   Speaking of being a good citizen with upstream projects, if you
    speak **Brazilian Portuguese** you'll be glad to know that the
    [GNOME](http://gnome.org), [KDE](http://kde.org),
    [XFCE](http://xfce.org), and [Openbox](http://icculus.org/openbox)
    desktop environments are in excelente shape as far as the
    localization effort goes. The Brazilian translation team for
    [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/) has also done a great job at
    delivering a localized desktop with their latest release! Now, I
    don't know where you get your translations but if it isn't being
    pulled (without modifications) from upstream, good luck pal!
-   Finally, between the many hours I have put into work these days
    (ever wonder why I haven't blogged much? now you know) I have
    managed to mess around with Django to scratch a need. If I were to
    describe what I think about this framework using as few words as
    possible, w00t and teh aw3s0m3 comes to mind! By the way, writing
    code with 2 other guys while discussing ideas over Skype? Great XP
    experience for those who cannot afford to travel!
