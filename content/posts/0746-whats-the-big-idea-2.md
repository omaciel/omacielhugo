title: What\'s the Big Idea?
---

Starting this Thursday, April 3, 2008 I'll be attending this year's
[What's the Big Idea?](http://fridaycenter.unc.edu/pdep/wbi/index.htm),
a series of lectures given by [UNC](http://www.unc.edu) Chapel Hill
scientists focusing on genetics, ethics and human health. For a mere 30
dollars I was able to register for all four lectures! The topics are
very interesting and close to my personal interests in bioinformatics
and gene therapy. Did you know I have a degree in biochemistry?

The series kicks off with a fairly interesting lecture: an introduction
to stem cell research and genetic engineering. Then, for the next 3
weeks there will be lectures on gene and tissue engineering, genetic
research and its medical applications, and the ethical, legal, and
social implications of genetics/genomics research. I can't hardly wait.
