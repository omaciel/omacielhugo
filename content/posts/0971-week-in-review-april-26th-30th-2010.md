Hereâ€™s what happened this week:

1.  [Coffee, a personal history](http://../?p=976)
    -   I first got hooked on drinking coffee back in the Spring of 1994
        while attending a **Microbiology** class at **Pace University**.
        Our class started way too early for me and our professor
        (canâ€™t remember her name right now) was this tiny old lady
        \[...\]
2.  [A Pig, an Elephant and a Yellow Dog](http://../?p=965)
    -   From the â€œ**Read a Book to a Child**â€? department, Iâ€™d like
        to recommend two **amazing books** that will be a sure hit for
        any kid, even the one inside you! â€œ[Watch Me Throw the
        Ball](http://bit.ly/9T4lIj)â€? **An Elephant & Piggie Book** by
        Mo Willems is a wonderful \[...\]
3.  [RESTful Web Services, Beautiful Soup and
    Launchpad](http://../?p=984)
    -   Last night I attended two short presentation by [Leonard
        Richardson](http://www.crummy.com/), author of the Oâ€™Reilly
        book [RESTful Web
        Services](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529260/) and
        developer on [Launchpad.net](http://launchpad.net/).
        Unfortunately it took me a while to find a parking spot \[...\]
4.  [Splitting WordPress Export File with
    ChoppedPress](http://../?p=993)
    -   Youâ€™re all probably tired of hearing me talking about my
        script to split the XML-like file that **WordPress** generates
        when you use the **Export** feature. Tonight I have finally
        added the final touches \[...\]
5.  [A Hamster, a Lynx and The Princess Brideâ€¦
    What???](http://../?p=1004)
    -   Got a couple of interesting bits for you today, starting with
        some really great news from the [Hamster
        Project](http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/), a time
        tracking application. My friend **Tom** wrote about his recent
        work \[...\]
