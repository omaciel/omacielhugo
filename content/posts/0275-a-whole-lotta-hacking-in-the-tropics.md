title: A whole lotta hacking (in the tropics)!

If anyone is planning on attending this year's [7º Fórum Internacional
Software Livre](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/7.0/www/), or **FISL** for
short, try to get a hold of [Mário
Meyer](https://launchpad.net/people/mariomeyer) and Cia. at the [Ubuntu
Brazil](http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/) booth! Tell him I have asked him
to show you a good time while you're in Brazil, and I can pretty much
guarantee you'll be speaking "fluent" portuguese in no time! ;) Too bad
I can't make it... That what you get for being a .NET consultant I
guess...
