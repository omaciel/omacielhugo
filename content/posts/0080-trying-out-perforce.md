title: Trying Out Perforce
---

Tonight I want to take a quick break from playing WoW and install
[Perforce](http://www.perforce.com) SCM System at home:

> The Perforce SCM System features comprehensive software configuration
> management capabilities built around a scalable client/server
> architecture. Requiring only TCP/IP, developers can access the
> Perforce Server through a variety of Perforce clients (GUIs for
> several platforms, Web, or Command-Line). Perforce can be deployed
> quickly and easily, and requires minimal administration, even for
> large or distributed sites.

Having used Microsoft's Visual Source Safe (VSS) for most part of my
professional life (now am being forced to use some old version of
PVCS!!! ARGHH!), I want to see if this tool could replace VSS. I first
heard of them at this year's Linux World Expo in Boston and was very
impressed with it, specially since it will run on Linux and has a 2
user/seat free version.

I'm not sure if I'm going to install the server under a Linux or Windows
system yet...
