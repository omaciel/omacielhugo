title: A DVCS model that embraces your model?
---

My good friend [Mario Ä?aniÄ‡](http://pygi.wordpress.com/) (pygi) wrote
a very interesting
[article](http://pygi.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/broken-by-birth/) on what
he calls a "broken on birth" attitude towards DVCS adoption in many open
source groups. I was very intrigued as to how one would allow different
developers use their own (i.e. favorite) DVCS to work on their project,
and yet be able to pool everything together in order to release a given
set? If you want to learn about his ideas, about
[GitoriousKDE](http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/GitoriousKDE) or have
some relevant feedback for him, drop him a line.
