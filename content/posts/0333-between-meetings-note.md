title: Between Meetings Note
---

Work has caught up to me and I have been flooded with small projects
here and there at work! I have received a great deal of feedback on how
to Ubuntunize my TabletPC and will be reporting on my progress as soon
as I get some time to breath.

meantime, while I away for yet another meeting, I just want to thank
[Sven Herzberg](http://herzi.eu/) for
[writing](http://herzi.eu/index.php?/archives/82-Handwriting....html)
about [HRE 2.1.0](http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/stuff/hre-2.1.0.tar.gz)
([Website](http://gtt.blaubeermuffin.de/Handwriting_Recognition_Engine)).
I am very much looking forward to playing with it very soon!
