After a very brief night of sleep (about 3 hours), Elizabeth started
having contractions, strong enough for us to drive to the hospital. At
around 5:18 EST our second daughter **Kate Maciel** was born!

There were some post-partum complications and Elizabeth lost a lot of
blood, but the doctors seem to have things under control now.

Nothing can prepare you for the roller coaster of emotions one goes
through when witnessing the birth of your child. Little Yv is the most
excited, and keeps asking me: "Daddy, when can we bring her home?"

Today, the [rPath](http://www.rpath.com/corp/) and
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) family has gained one more member! Just
ask my Y2K (Yv and Kate) duo here! ;)

Can you say "sleep deprived"?
