title: New XFCE Hat
---

I'm very excited to announce that I have taken the role of committer for
the Brazilian **XFCE** Team! I bring to the table my background as a
translator for the **GNOME** team for the last 9-10 months, as well as
my background as a translator and former leader of the Brazilian
**Ubuntu** Translation Team (and some minor contributions with the
Brazilian **KDE** Team).

I want to take the opportunity to properly thank **Adriano Winter Bess**
for kindly stepping down as the pt_BR translations maintainer, and
allowing me to take this role. I'm sure I have a pretty big "shoe to
fill" and I can only hope to do a job as great as he has in the past!

I already envision a major collaboration effort between the Brazilian
translation teams in order to create a single, standardized location
(together with the **LDP-BR** guys) for a vocabulary "repository".
Brazilian Portuguese speaking users of open sourced software should be
able to use their systems and have a standardized vocabulary throughout!

For those interested in participating in the translation process, please
swing by the **\#xfce-br** channel on **Freenode** and ping me (either
OgMaciel or GnuKemist).
