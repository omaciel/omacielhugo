title: Announcing Foresight Linux 2.5.0 ALPHA 2 GNOME Edition
---

Who said that lightening doesn't strike twice on the same spot? I'm
proud to announce the release of **Foresight Linux 2.5.0 ALPHA 2 GNOME
Edition**!

Once again, this alpha release is from our **QA branch**, and is
intended mostly to receive feedback on brand new installs from
end-users, specially in relation to the overall behavior of **X.org** on
first boot! Obviously, if you're already running Foresight Linux 2.5.0
ALPHA1, simply update your system from the command line: **\*sudo conary
updateall**\*

The following images are available for download right now:
