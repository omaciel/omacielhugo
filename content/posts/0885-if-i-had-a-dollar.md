... for everytime a heard a pediatrician say:

-   It is **probably some** virus;
-   There is **something** going around;
-   I'll prescribe some **amoxicillin**...;
-   It will go away in 6 to 8Â **weeks**;
-   I'll ask my colleagues;
-   We've been seeing that in the office a lot... it is **probably**
    some type of infection or virus;

I'd be rich! Growing up in Brazil, there was never a time that my
parents took me to a doctor that we didn't come home knowing precisely
what was affliciting me... and nothing that wasn't cured by some type of
shot and a day of rest.

The worst part of taking my kids to see a doctor with questions and
hearing the answers above, is having to **pay** them in the end!
