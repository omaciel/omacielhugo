title: Sorry for the noise...

![Sorry](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7035/6434625263_9937f1ae1f_d.jpg)I've
just recently started migrating my blog to
[Tumblr](http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com), and in the process of importing my
archives from **WordPress** I seem to have caused some issues with
certain aggregators that are now **picking up posts from 2007**...
Yesterday I also triggered a massive torrent on both **Twitter** and
**Facebook**...

Please accept my apologies for the incovenience... more on the Tumblr
migration to follow!
