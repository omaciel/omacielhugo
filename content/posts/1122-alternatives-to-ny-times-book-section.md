title: Alternatives to NY Times\' Book section
---

The **NY Times**\' restriction of 10 articles/month for non-subscribers,
online viewers means I won\'t be reading their **Books section**
anymore. It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look
forward to on Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace
and quietness as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the
latest books and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip
down to the public library with the whole family. Both of my kids are
already checking out more books and movies than my wife and I together.

But back to this decision by the NY Times, I understand that a for
profit establishment wants to, well, make money, and there's nothing
wrong with that for sure. But for this weekend, Books section only
reader the options don't make a lot of sense: **pay \$6 for the Sunday
edition** so I can read a small subset of it is a bit expensive, and I
am not very sure how much it costs to get the online version.
