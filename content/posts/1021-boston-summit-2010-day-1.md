Finally sat down to write down about my first day attending the **Boston
Summit 2010** but Paul

already beat me to it. From my perspective, it was really nice to
finally meet face to face with some of my fellow Board members and make
new friends!

I want to thank **Novell** for hosting us at their office for our Board
meeting (there should be a picture of us posing in front of a Novell
logo) and our gracious host. Also, everyone involved in organizing the
Summit and making sure things worked smoothly!

Looking forward to all the sessions for tomorrow!
