title: Tar Heel No More

Once again I avoided mentioning about a very serious job lead I had with
the [University of North Carolina](http://www.unc.edu) at the Chappel
Hill campus, afraid of jinxing myself. Well, today I have finally
recieved the final verdict after the 3-weeks long process: they decided
to go with a local candidate who had a slight advantage over me
(apparently some accounting and project management experience) and had
just lost her job. I confess I'm a bit disappointed at the moment for it
is the **fourth** position in a row I was genuinely interested that I
see slip through my fingers... I'm going to **try** to put a positive
spin on this and make myself believe that the best is yet to come...
Kind of hard to do when you think of the previous chances (Microsoft for
instance)... =/
