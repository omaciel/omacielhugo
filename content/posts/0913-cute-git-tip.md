I was hanging out in the lobby of the [Catalina Park
Appartments](http://www.catalinapark.es/) last week writing some code
when I was approached by **Diederik van der Boor** (of **KMess** fame)
who was also hacking away and had a question about Git.

-   **Diederik**: are you an expert on git by any chance?
-   **Me**: hardly, but what is the question?
-   **Diederik**: I just made a few changes to a single file and was
    wondering if it is possible to commit specific chunks?
-   **Me**: hmmmm... don't think so but that would be really cool!!!

He went back to his chair and I immediately starting scouring the web
for more information about this. Luckly, one of the very first hits I
got back was **Ryan Tomayko**\'s post called "[The Thing About
Git](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git)"! I had barely
read the entire article when I shouted to Diederik: "**I think I found a
solution! You better come over here and sit down!**\" What followed then
were several minutes of more reading, sprinkled with a lot of drooling
and happy exclamations from both of us!

I highly recommend you read the article, but the short answer is to use:

    git add --patch [modifed-file-name]

In other words, say you've modifed the files foo.py and bar.py.
Committing these 2 files with all their changes is straight forward, but
what if you only wanted to perform a partial commit of your changes to
bar.py? Easy enough! Commit foo.py as usual and use the ---patch "flag"
to commit bar.py.

> -   *d* â€" do not stage this hunk nor any of the remaining hunks in

> -   *j* â€" leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk

> -   *k* â€" leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk

>
> *s* â€" split the current hunk into smaller hunks" ([Ryan
> Tomayko](http://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git))

So, in other words:

    git add foo.py
    git add --patch bar.py

I don't know about you but this neat little trick made my day!
