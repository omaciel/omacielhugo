After breaking (I'm still clueless as for what really happened... Maybe
I zapped it by wearing my fleece sweater) my SanDisk 1GB jump drive
within 20 minutes of use last Wednesday, I finally drove back to CompUSA
and picked up this little fella. It aboslutely rocks! I've now installed
[Portable Firefox
1.0.1](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/portable_firefox/) and really
like it. Today I want to take the time to sort most of my MP3s and load
them in for a fun, music-filled day at work.
