title: Subscribe to feeds from projects hosted on Google Code
---

If you have a project hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com)
(or follow the development of a project) and don't want to create a
[Google Group](http://groups.google.com) so that you can receive
notifications (email, rss) for repository or issue tracking commits,
here's a new feature that has been added:

-   <http://code.google.com/feeds/p/>**PROJECT**/svnchanges/basic
-   <http://code.google.com/feeds/p/>**PROJECT**/issueupdates/basic

For the first url, change PROJECT to the project name you want to
follow.

Then, add the url to your favorite news reader.

**UPDATE**: AddingÂ ?path=DIR was not working so I changed the url for
project commits.
