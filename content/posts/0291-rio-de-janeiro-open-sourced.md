title: Rio de Janeiro Open Sourced
---

A new legislation (<http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/6524> in pt_BR)
has been approved in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by which the entire local
goverment institutions will have to give priority to Open Source
solutions!Ã‚Â  Hopefully the rest of the nation will follow soon and
make better use of all that money currently being spent on licenses and
what not...Ã‚Â  How about putting an end to poverty and illiteracy in
one of the largest countries in the world???
