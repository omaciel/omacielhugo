title: Sign of Times?
---

So yesterday I [found
out](http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2156209/sun-support-ubuntu-linux)
that Sun will (finally) get on the Open Source wagon...Ã‚Â  I'll refrain
from commenting on why I think they (Sun) have made this choice...Ã‚Â 
What I really want to know is:Ã‚Â  When will **Madobe**
(Macromedia+Adobe) wake up and smell the coffee???
