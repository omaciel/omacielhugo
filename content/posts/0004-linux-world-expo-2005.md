So here I am standing in front of the Gnome booth. Vinny and I got here
around 1-1:30pm thanks to his awsome navigational skills but were able
to see every single booth. The environment was very laid back and not as
"corporate" as last year's event in NYC. We managed to ask a few
questions, got a lot of cool stuff, even a complementary
made-in-front-of-you latte' at the CA's booth, and just enjoyed it all.
I donated some money to some of my favorite Open Source community and
came out with a nice green Debian t-shirt. I guess the highlight of my
day was when I finally managed to grab a hat from the Novell guys!!!
IMHO, it is a whole lot cooler than Red Hat's, but not as cool as their
baseball jersey with the words "Red Hat" in the back. Apparently you can
only get it at their online store. Kudos to HP and Intel for staffing
their booths with the blondies with the tight black pants!
