A couple of updates before heading out to the weekend:

Been working hard together with [FÃƒÂ¡bio
Nogueira](http://blog.ubuntuser.com.br) on the
[XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/) translations before the eminent **4.4.2**
release. Things are looking
[really](http://i18n.xfce.org/wiki/team_pt_br) good!

Tonight I was feeling a bit adventurous and took the pre-alpha
[Foresight](http://www.foresightlinux.org) 2.0 KDE Edition and installed
it at home. Like I said, I was really feeling adventurous and installed
the **x86_64** bit version too, and so far everything looks good!
**Amarok** feels really good right now! :) The whole idea is to allow me
to work on **Brazilian Portuguese** translations for
[KDE](http://www.kde.org/) and be able to see my work in use.

Speaking of translations, I want to thank the good folks at
[Maemo](http://maemo.org/) for accepting my application for the
[N810](http://nokia.com/n810). Look for some Brazilian Portuguese
goodness coming your way soon... :)

Look out for the official
[announcement](http://www.foresightlinux.org/releases/2-alpha-1/) and
directions on how to get your hands on a **Foresight 2.0 Alpha DVD GNOME
Edition**! Full installation time seems to be at around **5-7 minutes**!
My KDE install took 4 minutes! Blink and you may miss it! :P

I feel like I'm forgetting something but can't remember right now... Oh
wait! Yes! Does anyone know if it is possible to use Mugshot in
conjunction with Amarok? I mean, this application really rocks!
