Haven't received any offers of help with my RssReader.NET application...
but it's not like I was expecting offers anyhow. :) Yesterday and today
I spent some time making some changes to the UI as well adding some new
functionality. UI changes include:

-   Removed ComboBox control - Users will have to add new feeds via an
    interface.
-   Switched ListView control for a TreeView control - Will allow for
    expansion/collapsing of feeds and increase visibility of available
    posts.
-   Added a few buttons - These will disappear and are being used for
    testing purpose only.

New functionality include:

-   Add new feeds - Works!
-   Save (serializes) existing feeds - For offline reading. Needs some
    work.
-   Loads saved feeds - Same as above.

Right now I'm stuck due to some problems in serializing some of the
objects (RssFeedCollection to be exact). Help figuring this out will be
deeply appreciated. Maybe I should start a project in
[SourceForge](http://www.sourceforge.net)...
