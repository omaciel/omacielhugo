-   [BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) has
    attracted a new enthusiast who has brought a lot of interesting
    [ideas](http://groups.google.com/group/billreminder/t/14561b2323a90fec)
    to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/billreminder).
    The coolest part is that we both share a lot of ideas in common and
    I have already started to write some code to pave the way to more
    reporting and some true home accounting features. [![BillReminder

    After spending some time changing the charting module from the
    [hamster-applet](http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/) project to do
    what I needed, I came to learn about a pretty cool project for
    graphing with Cairo and Python called
    [CairoPlot](http://linil.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/cairoplot-11/)!
