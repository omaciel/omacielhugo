Forgot to post a screenie for my last changes to WickedReader: Buttons
to refresh, add, and remove (this one yet to be added mainly due to
lazyness from my part) feeds, and a Sage-like html rendering of all
posts for a given feed or individual posts. I have done so many changes
to the underlying "engine" (RSS.NET) that I've decided to re-write it
from scratch. Have spent these last 2 days elbow deep into the new code.
I could definitely use some help, specially with the data parsing... Any
volunteers?
