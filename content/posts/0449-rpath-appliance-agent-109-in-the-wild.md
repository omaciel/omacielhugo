title: rPath Appliance Agent 1.0.9 in the wild!
---

Today we have released [rPath Appliance
Agent](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/rPath_Appliance_Agent) (rAA) version
1.0.9!!! I'm very excited about this since it has 2 new features that I
worked on:

-   A new plugin for setting the time, date and timezone, and
    configuring the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
-   The rAA user password is now salted to provide additional security.

A long time ago I experienced the joy of seeing a program I had
developed and open sourced pick up over 30000 downloads on
downloads.com. But if you exclude my participation in the early stages
on the [AptOnCD](http://aptoncd.sourceforge.net/develop.html#people)
project, I have exclusively developed applications for internal use only
ever since.

Obviously the new features include more than just these 2 items (full
blown release notes
[here](http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/rAA/2006/12/08/rpath_appliance_agent_1_0_9_released)),
but it is very exciting to know that bits and pieces of my code will be
powering many [Linux Appliances](http://www.rpath.com/corp/) out there!
