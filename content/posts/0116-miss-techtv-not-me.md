[posts](http://www.markyville.com/techtv.html) about the now defunt tv
show The Screen Savers. It made it sound like it was a great show! PUAH!
TSS **was** an interesting show back in the
pre-Sarah-and-Kevin-and-hottie-girls-wearing-mini-skirts era! During the
last 2-3 seasons of its existence they completely lost its charm,
switching from a simple show that was actually helpfull to the computer
illiterate or novice, to a super commercialized show. Almost all of
their reviews and segments involved some type of commercial application
and some of the new members showed complete ignorance of the material
they were supposedly covering. It was very rare when they did any
significant Open Source or Linux coverage, and even then Kevin Rose (so
called Dark Tipper) seemed to be following some type of recipe. To those
of you still crying about the show being sacked: GET OVER IT!
