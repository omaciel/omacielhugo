Our doctors have told us that our second daughter will be born on
Valentines Day (February 14th for those who don't live in the US). But
what is science compared to my mother's sixth sense who, after having
just seen this photo sent to her via cellphone, boldly stated: she'll be
born by **tomorrow**! ;)
