title: \"Caving\" In
---

I finally caved in and gave **beryl** a try. After being literally
bombarded with screenshots and videos os people doing some pretty cool
stuff on their computers, I figured: "I have a pretty good system
here... why not add some bling to it?"

I followed my friend **Hamacker**\'s
[recipe](http://hamacker.wordpress.com/2006/10/19/aiglx-beryl-no-ubuntu-edgy-610/)
(in portuguese, but there's a good tutorial
[here](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/InstallingBeryl)
in english) and was running beryl in no time! I must have spent at least
1 hour just tweaking all the possible configurations allowed! That is
when I saw my friend **LedStyle**\'s
[recipe](http://www.tuxresources.org/blog/?p=103) for installing
**FlightGear**, the open source flight simulator. Though the
instructions are also in portuguese, there's a initial push to re-write
all the existing games recipes found on [Ubuntu
Games](http://ubuntugames.org/) to other languages, specially english.

The next 30 minutes were spent trying to get a F-16 to fly in a
**straight line** for a few seconds! You can see me taking off in the
picture above, but the several crashes will remain **top secret**! :)
