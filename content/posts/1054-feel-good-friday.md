This is more of a "feel good" post, mostly for me! Through my life I
have come across a fork on the road many times, and for the last 4+
years I have always chosen the path to the **right**. Even when the left
side sometimes looked a bit more "paved" and less difficult to walk
through, I still chose the **right path**! The reasons are many, but I
think I can distill them into one single sentence: I believe!

I'm talking about the technology that we develop here at
[rPath](http://www.rpath.com) and apparently, I'm not the only one to
feel this way either! It makes me extremely proud to know that something
I work on is perceived as a game changer to a bunch of people!
