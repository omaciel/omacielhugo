title: Openbox goodness!

Finally caught up with my rss feeds and found out about some new
[sexyness](http://d.minuslab.net/?p=65) coming up in
[Openbox](http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page). You'll need
to get Openbox([git](http://d.minuslab.net/?p=65)) and
Obconf([git](http://d.minuslab.net/?p=68)) from their respective git
repositories as well as [this](http://d.minuslab.net/files/hmmxp.tar.gz)
theme.

If you're running Foresight and want to try this (since it is still in
development, I didn't bother to submit it to a repo yet), let me know
and I'll get you the changeset.
