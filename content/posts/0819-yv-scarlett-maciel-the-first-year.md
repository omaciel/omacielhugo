As I uploaded 10000 pictures into F-Spot tonight, I got lost in the
memories of people, places and events that they brought back...
everything starting with the birth of my first daughter Yv. I cherry
picked a few pictures of her first year and created a
[set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ogmaciel/sets/72157606447407699). It
is amazing how time does fly... she's going to be 7 at the end of the
year!
