title: About gtk.SpinButton, my time widget and quick patches
---

Today I fixed issue **1864094** "[Time widget for individual alarms are
too
long](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1864094&group_id=161428&atid=819795)".
I ended up creating a brand new widget with gtk.SpinButtons instead of
gtk.ComboBoxes, since we determined that it would be useful for a
different dialog. This took me a bit longer than I expected because I
insisted that the hours should be zero padded (i.e. display 01, 02 and
not 1, 2, etc). After spending some time on this I finally gave him and
asked [Johan
Dahlin](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/describeuser.cgi?login=johan%40gnome.org)
if it was possible, to which I received a negative answer. I proceeded
to code my widget only to receive the news several minutes later that a
[patch](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507566) had already
been created and is now awaiting for someone to review. Is this awesome
or what?

I have also merged all the code being done in the 0.3 branch back into
trunk. So if you're looking for the latest stuff:

> *svn co
> \`https://billreminder.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/billreminder/trunk
> \<https://billreminder.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/billreminder/trunk\>\`\_\_
> billreminder*

**Luiz** today merged some code that should take care of localized
currency, so please test it!
