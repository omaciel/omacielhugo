title: Foresight Linux installation in 7 minutes!
---

That is what the new version of [Foresight
Linux](http://foresightlinux.org/) will offer with its new forthcoming
version 2! I heard the news from [Ken](http://ken.vandine.org/)
(Foresight's leader and co-worker) last night and it has been confirmed
by [Elliot](http://blog.bentlogic.net/), our Anaconda tamer. Obviously
your installation time may vary depending on your system, but I'm fairly
sure they've used a standard PC for this. Another worthy mention is the
addition of [PackageKit](http://www.packagekit.org/) as the graphical
interface for our [Conary](http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary) package
management system and we will definitely make a big splash with the
addition of the [Splashy](http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/wiki/) boot
splash! As always, you can expect the latest goodness from GNOME 2.20.1
and the latest versions of your favorite apps!
