title: Help me translate BillReminder
---

I need your help to get
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) translated into
as many different languages as possible! Up until now I have relied on a
list of collaborators who know how to work with a message catalog
template (i.e. pot file) and use it to generate a translated message
file (i.e. po file). I'm aware that a lot of people probably don't know
what I'm talking about and/or may feel uneasy about working with text
files and what not... so I decided to set
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) up for
translation via [Rosetta](https://translations.launchpad.net), which can
be reached [here](https://translations.launchpad.net/billreminder).

[![BillReminder can now be translated via

Once you have registered to use Rosetta, and you are part of one of the
many translation
[teams](https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators),
it should be extremely [easy](https://translations.launchpad.net/+about)
for you to help out with the translation effort. I'm looking forward to
seeing new languages added to the project just in time for an upcoming
release.
