Hereâ€™s what happened this week:

1.  [Quotes to brighten your day](http://../?p=886)
    -   Kind of ironic how my post titled â€œStop whining and improve
        your lifeâ€? attracted so much negativity in the comments area.
2.  [From the â€œUseful Django Tipâ€? Department: Reset The Admin
    Password](http://../?p=927)
    -   This comes straight from the Useful Django Tip department: How
        do you reset the admin password for a Django project when
        youâ€™ve forgotten it?
3.  [Helping downstream translations swim upstream: Part
    1](http://../?p=909)
    -   Sometimes, contributing back to upstream open source projects is
        not as straight forward as one may think. â€œHelping downstream
        translations swim upstreamâ€? will be a new series of articles
        where I intend to explain the issues contributors may face when
        attempting to send translations back to upstream projects, and
        hopefully, devise a couple of possible solutions.
4.  [Help sponsor Mercurial development!](http://../?p=944)
    -   Anyone who has ever added a project to BitBucket already knows
        what Mercurial is, but for those who have never heard about
        it...
5.  [Transifex adds new features, wins more hearts](http://../?p=947)
    -   It has been a great Spring for Transifex.net, everyoneâ€™s
        favorite open source translation portal!
6.  [Book Preview: Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging](http://../?p=949)
    -   What a great day to kick of the day! Just received my
        complimentary copy of the book â€œDjango 1.1 Testing and
        Debuggingâ€? from Packt Publishing!
