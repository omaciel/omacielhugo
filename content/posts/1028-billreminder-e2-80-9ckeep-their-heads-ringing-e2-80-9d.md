title: BillReminder "Keep Their Heads Ringing" Released

![BillReminder "Keep Their Heads Ringing" 0.4.0](http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/billreminder-0.4.0-300x300.png)

Just in time before the new year, it is with great pleasure that I
announce the release of
[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) "**Keep Their
Heads Ringing**\" 0.4.0 after a **27-month** hiatus! During this period
I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve the
user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the "core"
changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and
experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you
should have a good time playing with it.

[BillReminder](http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/) is not a
replacement for your accounting system or elaborate services such as
**Mint.com**. It's purpose is to **provide an easy way for getting
notified about upcoming payments keeping yourself ahead of your bills**!

BillReminder "Keep Their Heads Ringing" 0.4.0 can be downloaded from:

**Features**:

-   Switched most of the user interface code to **Glade** files with the
    hope that it will ease future contributions from ui developers.
-   Support for configuring notification alarms.
-   Switched database layer from custom code to **SQLAlchemy**.
-   Changed license from **BSD** to **GPL v3**.
-   A set of default categories are now created by default on
    new installations.
-   Better overall data validation when adding or editing bills.
-   Changed menu to use standard "**File**\" entry instead of
    previous \"**Bill**\" menu entry.
-   Borrowed **GConf** handler from the **Conduit** project and register
    gconf schema by default.
-   Added **charting support** from the **Hamster** project for better
    visualization of your expenditure.
-   A new **calendar widget** has been added to replace the calendar
    from the add/edit dialog. In order to display the calendar, it is
    necessary to expand the widget by clicking on the displayed date.
-   **Recurring bills** are now handled by selecting a frequency (the
    current allowed values are: **once, weekly, and monthly**) and
    setting the end date. Multiple records will then be added using the
    start and end date to figure out their correct due date.
-   A new **timeline widget** has been added to replace the calendar
    from the main window. You can now use it to change the way you view
    your bills by selecting an specific date with a single click as well
    as drag the timeline to view past and/or future bills. The following
    keyboard shortcuts are available:

    -   right arrow     go to next day
    -   left arrow      go to previous day
    -   Ctrl + right    go to same day next month
    -   Ctrl + left     go to same day previous month

        -   (plus)        zoom in

        -   (minus)       zoom out

    -   HOME            go to today's date
    -   PAGEUP          scroll to next screen**\***
    -   PAGEDOWN        scroll to previous screen

**\*** *go to current day plus the number of days displayed in widget.*

-   \#551953: It should be possible to add bills without an amount
    defined.
-   \#553890: Different install/data paths.
-   \#554228: Changed Record to Bill to be consistent with nomenclature.
-   \#555136: Import sqlite3 if using python 2.5, or pysqlite2 if using

    is 'None'.

    the widget's height.

A special "**THANK YOU**\" goes out to **Toms Bau?is** for keeping me
excited about programming by making the **Hamster** project an awesome
tool, never shying away from lending me a hand every now and then and
for letting me bounce ideas whenever I feel like trying some new
approach to a problem!
