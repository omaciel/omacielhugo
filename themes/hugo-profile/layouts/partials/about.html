                 I was born in the northern-most part of <span class="badge text-light rounded-pill bg-primary">Brazil</span> but have adopted <span class="badge text-light rounded-pill bg-primary">The United States of America</span> as my home since 1991.

                I work remotely as a <span class="badge text-light rounded-pill bg-primary">Software Engineering Senior Manager</span>

                I first learned to program in Basic on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK90X">TK90X</a> while reading

                After knocking around a couple of pharmaceutical startups,
